# Resolution of singularities: the algebraic main theorems

## Conventions

An *algebraic `k`-scheme* (`X : AlgScheme k`) is a scheme `X.left` whose structure morphism
`X.left ↘ Spec k` is separated and of finite type (`FiniteType`; Hironaka's "algebraic `B`-scheme";
Kollár's "scheme of finite type over a field", made separated); its morphisms are the `k`-morphisms.
In prose `X` also denotes the scheme `X.left`.
*Reduced and irreducible* is `IsIntegral` (`isIntegral_iff_irreducibleSpace_and_isReduced`).
*Non-singular* (`IsRegular`) means that every local ring `𝒪_{X,x}` is a regular local ring, and the
*singular locus* (`singularLocus`) is the set of points where it is not. *Smooth over `k`* is
Mathlib's `Smooth` of the structure morphism, and *equidimensional* means that the smooth locus has
a single relative dimension over `k` (`X.left.IsReducedEquidimensional k`: reduced and
equidimensional); for a smooth `X` this is smoothness of a single relative dimension `n`
(`SmoothOfRelativeDimension n`), written "smooth and equidimensional". Over the perfect field `k` a
smooth scheme is non-singular. The *monoidal transformation* of `X` with centre the closed subscheme
of ideal sheaf `D` is `D.blowUp`, with projection `D.blowUpπ`; a *finite succession of monoidal
transformations* is a `BlowUpSequence X`, Kollár's blow-up sequence with specified centres
(`S.center i`), stages (`S.stage i`) and composite `S.composite : S.last ⟶ X`. A morphism is
*projective* (`IsProjective`) when it is a closed immersion into the projective bundle
`P(E) = Proj (Sym E)` (`E.projectiveBundle`) of a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules `E` of finite type
(Mathlib's `Y.Modules` with `IsQuasicoherent` and `IsFiniteType`), followed by the projection of the
bundle [Sta, Tag 01W8]; a projective morphism is proper. Ideal sheaves are
Mathlib's `X.IdealSheafData`, closed subschemes are given by their ideal sheaves, and "`D` is
reduced" is `IsReduced D.subscheme`. Two hypotheses of Main Theorems II and II(N) and Corollary 1
(the second also of Corollary 3) are given in the transcription's reading rather than in Hironaka's
words: his "coherent sheaf of non-zero ideals" is an ideal sheaf with nonzero stalks, and his
"non-singular" is smoothness over `k`. Of his "reduced subscheme of everywhere codimension one" only
the reducedness is assumed. The regularity of every local ring and the invertibility of the ideal
sheaf of the boundary are not separate hypotheses: both follow from the hypotheses kept (regularity
from `IsSncBoundary` and from smoothness over the perfect field `k`; invertibility of the boundary
ideal from reducedness and normal crossings on a regular scheme). The order `J.ord x` of an ideal
sheaf at a point is Hironaka's `ν(J_x)`, the largest `ν` with `J_x ⊆ 𝔪_x^ν` for the stalk
`J_x = J.stalkIdeal x`, valued in `ℕ∞`.

`E_{i+1} = red(f_i⁻¹(E_i) ∪ f_i⁻¹(D_i))`. -/

by one of its members and cuts out `D` by some of its members. This is a condition at the points
of `D` only: nothing is asserted at the points off `D`. -/

end ClausesII

/-- **Hironaka's Main Theorem II** [Hir64, Main Theorem II, pp. 142–143]: order reduction. Let `X`
be a smooth algebraic `k`-scheme (`AlgScheme k`), `k` of characteristic zero, `J` an ideal sheaf on
`X` with nonzero stalks whose greatest order `ν(J_x)` over the points `x` of `X` is `d`, and `E₀` a
reduced closed subscheme of `X` with only normal crossings. Then there is a finite succession of
monoidal transformations `f_i : X_{i+1} → X_i` with centres `D_i ⊆ X_i` such that
* (i) each `D_i` is non-singular and irreducible (`BlowUpSequence.HasRegularIrreducibleCenters`);
* (ii) the weak transform `J_i` of `J` on `X_i` has order at least `d` at every point of `D_i`;
* (iii) with `E_{i+1} = red(f_i⁻¹(E_i) ∪ f_i⁻¹(D_i))`, each `E_i` has only normal crossings with
  `D_i`;
* (iv) `E_r` has only normal crossings and `J_r` has order less than `d` at every point of `X_r`.

Clause (iii) and the first half of (iv) are `BlowUpSequence.HasSncBoundaries`; the second half of
(iv) is the last conjunct. The weak transform `J_{i+1}` is the pull-back of `J_i` along `f_i`
divided by the largest power of the ideal of the exceptional divisor that divides it; "has only
normal crossings (with)" is Hironaka's Definition 2 (`IsSncBoundary`, `IsSncBoundaryWith`), which
on a scheme is simple normal crossings of the reduced `E_i`: the condition `DivisorFamily.IsSnc`
(`DivisorFamily.HasSncWith`) of the functorial theorems, read on the family of irreducible
components of `E_i`.

For `d = 0` (`J = 𝒪_X`), which the printed statement does not exclude, clause (iv) forces `X_r` to
be empty; blowing up the irreducible components of `X` one after another achieves it
(`Hironaka.Sequence.exists_blowUpSequence_isEmpty_last_of_smooth`). Hironaka's monoidal
transformation, defined by a universal property [Hir64, pp. 129, 166], is empty over a centre that
is a whole component, and clause (i) asks no density.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `S.weakTransformSeq J i` is Hironaka's $J_i$, `S.boundarySeq E₀ i` his $E_i$,
  and `J.ord x` his $\nu(J_x)$; `IsGreatest (Set.range J.ord) d` says that $d$ is the greatest
  of the orders $\nu(J_x)$.
* **Translation.** `[Smooth (X.left ↘ Spec (.of k))]` is Hironaka's "non-singular": for a scheme of
  finite type over the perfect field `k` the two agree (smoothness gives the regularity of every
  local ring, and a non-singular such scheme is smooth). As in the print, the irreducible components
  of `X` may have different dimensions.
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "coherent sheaf of non-zero ideals" is read as an ideal sheaf
  (`X.left.IdealSheafData`, quasi-coherent, hence coherent on the Noetherian `X`) with nonzero
  stalks (`hJ`).
* **Restatement.** The regularity of the local rings of `X` and the invertibility of the ideal sheaf
  of `E₀` ("of everywhere codimension one"), which Hironaka also assumes, are not separate
  hypotheses: they follow from the hypotheses kept (regularity from smoothness over the perfect
  field `k`; invertibility from reducedness and normal crossings on a regular scheme, see
  `IsSncBoundaryWith`). Of his "reduced subscheme of everywhere codimension one" only the
  reducedness, `[IsReduced E₀.subscheme]`, is assumed.
* **Out of scope.** Hironaka's remark that the theorem remains true over any local ring of his class
  ℬ [Hir64, p. 151; ℬ defined on p. 161], which he uses for local rings of analytic spaces (Main
  Theorem II′, p. 152). The base here is a field of characteristic zero, as in the print ("a field
  **B** of characteristc [sic] zero"). -/

/-- **Hironaka's Main Theorem II(N)** [Hir64, Main Theorem II(N), p. 176]: principalization by
iterated order reduction. Let `X` be a smooth algebraic `k`-scheme (`AlgScheme k`), `k` of
characteristic zero, `J` an ideal sheaf on `X` with nonzero stalks, and `E` a reduced closed
subscheme of `X` with only normal crossings. Then there is a finite succession of monoidal
transformations `f_i : X_{i+1} → X_i` with centres `B_i ⊆ X_i` such that
* (1) each `B_i` is non-singular and irreducible (`BlowUpSequence.HasRegularIrreducibleCenters`);
* (2) for each `i` there is a positive integer `d_i` that is the greatest order of the weak
  transform `J_i` of `J` on `X_i` and its order at every point of `B_i`;
* (3) with `E_{i+1} = red(f_i⁻¹(E_i ∪ B_i))`, each `E_i` has only normal crossings with `B_i`;
* (4) `E_r` has only normal crossings and `J_r = 𝒪_{X_r}`.

Clause (3) and the first half of (4) are `BlowUpSequence.HasSncBoundaries`; the second half of (4)
is the last conjunct. II(N) writes `red(f_i⁻¹(E_i ∪ B_i))` where II writes
`red(f_i⁻¹(E_i) ∪ f_i⁻¹(D_i))`, the same reduced subscheme: both are the reduced structure on
`f_i⁻¹(|E_i| ∪ |B_i|)`. For `J = 𝒪_X` the empty succession satisfies every clause.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** The notation is that of Main Theorem II
  (`exists_blowUpSequence_ord_weakTransformSeq_lt`): `S.weakTransformSeq J i` is $J_i$ and
  `S.boundarySeq E i` is $E_i$. `S.weakTransformSeq J (Fin.last S.length) = ⊤` is
  $J_r = \mathcal{O}_{X_r}$, the top ideal sheaf `⊤` being the unit ideal.
* **Translation.** As in Main Theorem II, `[Smooth (X.left ↘ Spec (.of k))]` is Hironaka's
  "non-singular" (the two agree for a scheme of finite type over the perfect field `k`).
* **Interpretation.** As in Main Theorem II, Hironaka's "coherent sheaf of non-zero ideals" is read
  as an ideal sheaf with nonzero stalks (`hJ`).
* **Gap.** Hironaka's "algebraic scheme" [Hir64, Ch. I, p. 162] is a scheme of finite type over
  $\operatorname{Spec} S$ for some local ring $S$ of his class ℬ (Noetherian, residue field of
  characteristic zero, his condition (ii) on completions, p. 161), a class containing every field of
  characteristic zero and the local rings of analytic spaces. Here `X` is separated and of finite
  type over a field `k` of characteristic zero.
* **Restatement.** As in Main Theorem II, the regularity of `X` and the invertibility of the ideal
  sheaf of `E`, which Hironaka also assumes, are not separate hypotheses: they follow from the
  hypotheses kept (regularity from smoothness over the perfect field `k`; invertibility from
  reducedness and normal crossings on a regular scheme).
* **Restatement.** Hironaka states the theorem for $X$ of dimension $N$, the index of the
  fundamental theorem II₂^N from which he deduces it [Hir64, p. 176]; $N$ does not appear in the
  conclusion. The statement here is II(N) for all $N$ at once. As in the print, `X` may have several
  irreducible components (Hironaka reduces the proof to irreducible $X$). -/

/-- **Kollár's functorial principalization** [Kol07, Theorem 35]. There is a family `BP` of blow-up
sequence functors on triples (`BlowUpSequenceFunctor (Triple k)`), one for each field `k` of
characteristic zero, such that
* every value `BP(X, I, E)`, with composite `Π : X_r → X`, is a principalization of the triple
  (`Triple.IsPrincipalizedBy`): (1) every centre is smooth over `k` and has simple normal
  crossings with the total transform of `E` at its stage; (2) `Π^* I` is the ideal sheaf of a simple
  normal crossing divisor; (3) `Π` is an isomorphism over `X ∖ (cosupp I ∪ Sing E)`;
* (4) `BP` commutes with smooth morphisms [Kol07, 34.1] (`CommutesWithSmoothMorphisms`) and with
  change of fields [Kol07, 34.2] (`CommutesWithChangeOfFields`);
* (5) `BP` commutes with closed embeddings when the boundary is empty [Kol07, 34.3]
  (`CommutesWithClosedEmbeddingsOfEmptyBoundary`).

A triple (`Triple`, [Kol07, Notation 64]) is a smooth, equidimensional algebraic `k`-scheme `X` with
an ideal sheaf `I` nonzero at every point and a simple normal crossing divisor family `E`.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `S.pullback h` is Kollár's pull-back $h^* S$ [Kol07, 30.1],
  `(S.pullback h).eraseEmpty` the same with the blow-ups with empty centre deleted [Kol07, 32], and
  `S.pushforward j` the push-forward $j_* S$ along a closed embedding [Kol07, 30.3];
  `T.I.comap S.composite` is $\Pi^* I$, and `T.E.singularLocus` is $\operatorname{Sing} E$, the set
  of points on at least two components of $E$.
* **Correction.** Clause (3) is stated over
  $X \setminus (\operatorname{cosupp} I \cup \operatorname{Sing} E)$ (`Triple.IsPrincipalizedBy`):
  $\Pi$ is an isomorphism away from the cosupport of $I$ and from the points on at least two
  components of $E$. Kollár prints $X \setminus \operatorname{cosupp} I$, but his functor first
  blows up the intersections of the components of $E$ [Kol07, 72], which need not lie in
  $\operatorname{cosupp} I$; the two loci agree when $E = \emptyset$.
* **Correction.** The order reduction $BMO_1$ of [Kol07, Theorem 107] that the proof runs splits a
  marked ideal as $I = M(I) \cdot N(I)$ with the monomial part
  $M(I) = \prod_D \mathcal{I}_D^{\operatorname{ord}_D I}$ taking one exponent per irreducible
  component $D$ of the boundary members
  (`Hironaka.BMO.monomialPart`; the split of [Wlo05, Section 3, Step 2]). Kollár's construction
  [Kol07, 111] takes one exponent per member, the minimum of $\operatorname{ord}_D I$ over the
  member's components; that split does not commute with open immersions, so clause (2) of
  [Kol07, Theorem 107] fails for it: on $\mathbb{A}^2$ with $E^1 = V(x(x-1))$, $E^2 = V(y(y-1))$ and
  $I = (xy)$ both exponents are $0$, and both are $1$ on the open set $x \ne 1$, $y \ne 1$. The
  fine split commutes with smooth pull-back, since orders at generic points are preserved.
* **Gap.** The inputs are the triples $(X, I, E)$ of [Kol07, Notation 64] (`Triple`), under which
  Kollár proves the theorem: their ambient scheme $X$ is smooth and equidimensional, whereas Theorem
  35 as printed does not ask $X$ to be equidimensional. The base change of a triple along a field
  extension is again a triple.
* **Gap.** Kollár's $E$ is an unordered simple normal crossing divisor. Here it is an ordered family
  (`DivisorFamily`), and clause (4) compares values on families with the induced orders; nothing
  relates the values at two orderings of one divisor. -/

/-- **Hironaka's Corollary 3** [Hir64, Corollary 3, p. 146], the simplification of an algebraic
boundary. Let `X` be a smooth algebraic `k`-scheme (`AlgScheme k`), `k` of characteristic zero, and
`W` a nowhere dense closed subscheme of `X`, given by its ideal sheaf. Then there is a finite
succession of monoidal transformations `f_i : X_{i+1} → X_i` with non-singular centres `D_i ⊆ X_i`
such that
* (i) the end result `X_r` is non-singular;
* (ii) every centre lies over `W`: `D_i ⊆ f̄_i⁻¹(W)`, where `f̄_i = f_0 ∘ ⋯ ∘ f_{i-1} : X_i → X`;
* (iii) the associated reduced scheme `red(f̄_r⁻¹(W))` of `f̄_r⁻¹(W)` is defined by an invertible
  sheaf of ideals on `X_r` and has only normal crossings.

Hironaka asks nothing of `W` beyond nowhere density; `W` may be empty (the unit ideal sheaf, of
nowhere dense support), for which the empty succession satisfies every clause.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** $\bar f_i$ is `S.stageMap i.castSucc` and $\bar f_r$ is `S.composite`. The
  associated reduced scheme $\mathrm{red}(\bar f_r^{-1}(W))$ is the radical
  `(W.comap S.composite).radical` of the inverse image ideal sheaf; "invertible" is `IsInvertible`
  (generated on an affine neighbourhood of every point by a nonzerodivisor, an effective Cartier
  divisor; on the locally Noetherian `X_r` this is the stalkwise condition that every stalk is
  generated by a nonzerodivisor of the local ring, `isInvertible_iff_forall_stalkIdeal_eq_span`),
  and "has only normal crossings" is Hironaka's Definition 2 (`IsSncBoundary`).
* **Translation.** Clause (ii) is read on points: every point of a centre maps into the support of
  `W`; since $D_i$ is non-singular, hence reduced, this is the inclusion
  $D_i \subseteq \bar f_i^{-1}(W)$ of subschemes.
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "nowhere dense" for the closed subscheme $W$ of $X$ is read
  topologically, of its support (`IsNowhereDense (W.support : Set X.left)`).
* **Translation.** `[Smooth (X.left ↘ Spec (.of k))]` is Hironaka's "non-singular" for `X`: for a
  scheme of finite type over the perfect field `k` the two agree (smoothness gives the regularity of
  every local ring, and a non-singular such scheme is smooth).
* **Restatement.** The regularity of the local rings of `X` is not a separate hypothesis: it follows
  from smoothness over the perfect field `k`. -/

/-- **Kollár's functorial resolution** [Kol07, Theorem 36]. There is a family `BR` of blow-up
sequence functors on reduced equidimensional algebraic `k`-schemes (`BlowUpSequenceFunctor
(ReducedEquidimensionalScheme k)`), one for each field `k` of characteristic zero, such that
* every value `BR(X)`, with composite `Π : X_r → X`, is a strong resolution of `X` [Kol07, (3)]
  (`BlowUpSequence.IsStrongResolution`): `Π` is projective and birational, and (1) `X_r` is smooth
  over `k`; (2) `Π` is an isomorphism over the smooth locus `X^{ns}`; (3) `Π⁻¹(Sing X)` is the
  support of a simple normal crossing divisor;
* (4) `BR` commutes with smooth morphisms [Kol07, 34.1] (`CommutesWithSmoothMorphisms`) and with
  change of fields [Kol07, 34.2] (`CommutesWithChangeOfFields`).

A smooth equidimensional scheme is an input, and `Π` may then be the identity. The irreducible
components of an input may meet: the two axes `xy = 0` in the plane are an input.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `(X.left ↘ Spec (.of k)).smoothLocus`, Mathlib's `smoothLocus` of the structure
  morphism, is Kollár's $X^{ns}$, and its complement is $\operatorname{Sing} X$; over a field of
  characteristic zero it is the set of points with regular local ring
  (`Scheme.mem_smoothLocus_iff_isRegularAt`).
* **Interpretation.** Kollár's clause (3), "$\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$ is a divisor with
  simple normal crossings", is read with the reduced structure on $\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$:
  it is `IsSncDivisor` of that set of points.
* **Gap.** Kollár states the theorem for all schemes of finite type over `k`. The inputs here
  (`ReducedEquidimensionalScheme`) are the reduced, equidimensional ones
  (`Scheme.IsReducedEquidimensional`), whose irreducible components may meet; the non-reduced
  schemes and the schemes with components of different dimensions are excluded, and (4) is asserted
  only between inputs. Kollár proves the theorem by feeding triples in the sense of
  [Kol07, Notation 64] (smooth equidimensional ambient schemes) to Theorem 35, and the construction
  here needs both restrictions: for a non-reduced `X` the strict transform at which the run is
  truncated need not be reduced; for components of different dimensions (4) fails. For `X` the
  cuspidal curve `y² = x³`, `Y = X ⊔ (X × 𝔸¹)` and the smooth surjection `h = 𝟙 ⊔ pr₁`, the run on
  an embedding of `Y` first blows up only the cusp line of the second piece, where the order is `2`,
  whereas `h^* BR(X)` first blows up the preimage of the cusp point, which contains the cusp point
  of the first piece. Kollár's remark that 34.1 is a local property is where a proof for mixed
  dimensions would be needed; none is printed.
* **Restatement.** Kollár's clauses (1)–(3) for the blow-up sequence $BR(X)$ are stated as
  `IsStrongResolution`, which also asks that $\Pi$ be projective and birational: a strong
  resolution in the sense of [Kol07, (3)], as the sentence introducing the theorem says ("we obtain
  strong and functorial resolution"). Both follow from the other clauses: the composite of a
  succession of blow-ups of a Noetherian scheme is projective, and by (2) $\Pi$ is an isomorphism
  over the smooth locus, which is dense.
* **Formalisation note.** The class of inputs is stable under change of fields and under étale
  `k`-morphisms, so (4) covers the base change of every input along every field extension and
  every étale morphism to an input: over a field of characteristic zero a reduced scheme of finite
  type is geometrically reduced [Sta, Tag 020I], smoothness is stable under base change
  [Sta, Tag 01VB] and fpqc local on the base [Sta, Tag 02VL], an étale morphism has reduced source
  when its target is reduced [Sta, Tag 033B], and smoothness descends along smooth surjections
  [Sta, Tag 02K5]. These stability facts are not formalized: applying (4) to a given base change
  requires showing that it is an input. -/

/-- **Kollár's strong resolution of singularities** [Kol07, Theorem 27]. Let `X` be a variety (an
integral algebraic `k`-scheme) over a field `k` of characteristic zero. Then there is a birational
and projective morphism `Π : X' → X`, the composite `S.composite` of a succession of blow-ups `S`
of `X`, that is a strong resolution of `X` (`BlowUpSequence.IsStrongResolution`): (1) `X'` is
smooth over `k`; (2) `Π` is an isomorphism over the smooth locus `X^{ns}`; (3) `Π⁻¹(Sing X)` is
the support of a simple normal crossing divisor. Projectivity and birationality are part of
`BlowUpSequence.IsResolution`; birationality is the isomorphism over a dense open subset of `X`,
here the smooth locus.

This is resolution of singularities in its usual form: a smooth `X'` with a projective birational
morphism to `X`, here a succession of blow-ups. Kollár's weaker form [Kol07, Corollary 22], a
smooth `X'` with a birational projective morphism to `X` and no conditions (2) and (3), is the part
`BlowUpSequence.IsResolution` of the conclusion.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** Kollár's variety is an integral algebraic `k`-scheme, `X : AlgScheme k` with
  `[IsIntegral X.left]`.
* **Translation.** Kollár's "birational and projective morphism" is the projectivity
  (`IsProjective`, [Sta, Tag 01W8]) and the birationality of `BlowUpSequence.IsResolution`.
* **Interpretation.** Kollár's clause (3), "$\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$ is a divisor with
  simple normal crossing", is read with the reduced structure on $\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$,
  as in Theorem 36 (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_functorial_resolution`).
* **Strengthening.** Kollár assumes `X` quasi-projective, which his proof uses to embed `X` in a
  projective space; no such hypothesis is made here.
* **Strengthening.** Here $\Pi$ (`S.composite`) is in addition the composite of a succession of
  blow-ups of `X`, whose centres are not asserted to be smooth; Theorem 27 as printed does not say
  this. It matches Kollár's construction: his $R(X)$ is the birational transform of $X$ that is a
  centre $Z_j$ of a succession of smooth blow-ups of an ambient smooth $P$, and by restriction
  [Kol07, 30.2] his $\Pi$ is the composite of the blow-ups of the birational transforms of $X$ along
  their intersections with the earlier centres, which may be singular [Kol07, Warning 23]. -/

/-- **Włodarczyk's embedded desingularization with smooth centres** [Wlo05, Theorem 1.0.2]. There
is a family `ED` of blow-up sequence functors on embedded pairs
(`BlowUpSequenceFunctor (EmbeddedPair k)`), one for each field `k` of characteristic zero, such
that
* every value `S = ED(X, Y)`, with composite `σ : X_r → X`, exceptional divisors `E_i` (the total
  transforms of the empty divisor family) and strict transforms `Y_i` of `Y`, is an embedded
  desingularization of the pair (`EmbeddedPair.IsDesingularizedBy`): every centre `C_i` is smooth
  over `k`; (a) every `E_i`, the last included, is a simple normal crossing family, and `C_i` has
  simple normal crossings with `E_i`; (b) no point of `C_i ∩ Y_i` lies over a point of `Reg(Y)`,
  the image in `X` of the smooth locus of `Y → Spec k` (the points where `Y`, not `Y_i`, is
  smooth); (c) `Ỹ = Y_r` is smooth over `k` and has simple normal crossings with `E_r`; (e)
  `σ^*(I_Y) = I_Ỹ · J` for the ideal sheaf `J` of a simple normal crossing divisor supported in
  `E_r`;
* (d) for a morphism of embedded pairs `h : (X', Y') ⟶ (X, Y)` whose underlying morphism is
  smooth, `ED(X', Y')` is the pull-back `h^* S` if `h` is surjective, and `h^* S` with the empty
  blow-ups deleted if the image of `h` meets every irreducible component of `Y`
  (`CommutesWithSmoothMorphismsMeetingComponents`).

An embedded pair (`EmbeddedPair`) is a reduced closed subscheme `Y` of a smooth, equidimensional
algebraic `k`-scheme `X` (smooth of one relative dimension over `k`); a morphism
`(X', Y') ⟶ (X, Y)` is a `k`-morphism `h : X' → X` along which the ideal sheaf of `Y` pulls back to
that of `Y'`. If `Y = X` (the ideal sheaf `⊥`), (b) forces every centre to be empty. If `Y` is
empty or smooth, the clauses on `S` alone hold for the empty succession.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `S.totalTransformSeq (DivisorFamily.empty _) i` is Włodarczyk's exceptional
  divisor $E_i$, `S.strictTransformSeq P.Y i` his strict transform $Y_i$, and the image in `X` of
  the smooth locus of `Y → Spec k` is his $\operatorname{Reg}(Y)$.
* **Interpretation.** Włodarczyk's "subvariety $Y$ of a smooth variety $X$" is read as a reduced
  closed subscheme `Y` of a smooth, equidimensional algebraic `k`-scheme `X` (`EmbeddedPair`). His
  Bravo–Villamayor strengthening, the source of clause (e), is stated for "a reduced closed
  subscheme" [Wlo05, Theorem 4.7.1].
* **Gap.** In clause (e), $\sigma^*(I_Y) = I_{\tilde Y} I_{\tilde E}$, Włodarczyk's divisor
  $\tilde E$ is "a natural combination of the irreducible components of the divisor $E_r$"; here `J`
  is only asked to be the ideal sheaf of a simple normal crossing divisor supported in $E_r$.
* **Gap.** In clause (d) the deletion form, in which `ED(X', Y')` is the pull-back of `ED(X, Y)`
  with the empty blow-ups deleted, is asserted only when the image of `h` meets every component of
  `Y`, whereas Włodarczyk's (d), read through his Definition 2.1.5 (extensions by isomorphisms) and
  Proposition 2.4.2, asserts it for every smooth `h`. The construction handles the components of `Y`
  in rounds whose boundary data depend on all of them, and over an open subset missing a component
  the runs fall out of step: for `Y` the disjoint union of a smooth surface and the three coordinate
  axes through a point off it, in a smooth threefold, the pull-back of `ED(X, Y)` to the complement
  of the surface has three non-empty centres that the run on that complement lacks.
* **Gap.** The parts of Włodarczyk's (d) on embeddings of ambient varieties and on equivariance
  under group actions have no counterpart; in particular, although the family `ED` has one functor
  for each field, no clause relates the functors of different fields, as Kollár's change of fields
  [Kol07, 34.2] (`CommutesWithChangeOfFields`) does. The functor built here is not Włodarczyk's
  single invariant-driven run, and functoriality for closed embeddings is, in Kollár's words, "quite
  delicate" [Kol07, 34 and Claim 71.2]: he proves it only for an empty boundary, whereas the later
  rounds here run with the exceptional divisors of the earlier ones as boundary. -/
