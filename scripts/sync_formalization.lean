# The generated regions of `formalization.yaml`, and the docstring sections they compile

Run as `lake lean scripts/sync_formalization.lean` from the directory of `lakefile.toml`: Lake
builds the library this file imports and hands it to Lean (from its artifact cache when it is
cached), and the computation below runs on the environment it gives.

## The docstring sections

The docstring of a main theorem (a theorem of `comparator.json`), and of a definition its statement
uses, says how the statement relates to its source in a section headed by the line
`Relation to the source.` on its own, followed by Markdown bullets, each beginning with one of the
bold labels `**Translation.**`, `**Unformalised.**`, `**Out of scope.**`, `**Correction.**`,
`**Interpretation.**`, `**Restatement.**`, `**Strengthening.**`, `**Gap.**` and
`**Formalisation note.**`:
```
Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `S.weakTransformSeq J i` is Hironaka's $J_i$, and `S.boundarySeq E₀ i` his $E_i$.
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "coherent sheaf of non-zero ideals" is read as …
* **Gap.** Hironaka's "algebraic scheme" is of finite type over a local ring of his class ℬ; …
```
An item may contain inline code and inline LaTeX `$…$`. The kinds are those of verso-blueprint's
editorial annotations, chosen by three questions in order. Does the source's item have a formalised
counterpart? If not, it is *Unformalised* (a statement or proof is missing) or *Out of scope* (none
is owed, by decision). Is the source's claim true as printed? If it is false, a *Correction* adds
the hypothesis it needs and states the corrected version; if it is underspecified, an
*Interpretation* fixes one reading. For a true claim, how do the statements compare? A
*Restatement* is a logically equivalent form, a *Strengthening* implies the source's statement, and
a *Gap* is weaker or incomparable. A *Translation* is a dictionary entry (this Lean expression is
the source's such-and-such), whatever the answers. A *Formalisation note* is the fallback for a
remark that is none of these, such as one on the form of a statement that no source prints.

A section is read by the rules of the blueprint, which renders each item as a box
(`Informal.SourceRelation.parse` in verso-blueprint; the script repeats them, so that both read the
same items, hence the same hashes, from every docstring):
* the heading is the first line whose text, without leading and trailing whitespace, is exactly
  `Relation to the source.`; its indentation is the section's base indentation;
* after the heading (blank lines allowed) comes a list of bullets: a bullet is a line indented at
  most three columns more than the heading whose text starts with `*`, `-` or `+` followed by a
  space or a tab (a tab counts as one column);
* an item continues on the following lines that are indented more than its bullet and are not
  bullets themselves; blank lines inside an item separate paragraphs;
* the section ends before the first non-blank line that is neither a bullet nor a continuation, or
  at the end of the docstring;
* each item begins with exactly one of the bold labels, the period inside the bold; its text is
  everything after the label, continuation lines included.

The script checks the format, and fails (a nonzero exit status) if
* a section has a bullet that does not begin with one of the labels, has no bullets, has an
  item with no text, or appears twice in one docstring;
* a main theorem has no section;
* a declaration of `Hironaka` with a section is neither a main theorem, nor another theorem with
  `@[source]` tags, nor a declaration that the statement of a main theorem uses, so that its
  items would be compiled nowhere;
* a docstring still has the heading `Deviations from the source.` of the earlier format.

## The generated regions

`formalization.yaml` has two regions that this script writes, each between two comment lines that
it owns,
```
  # BEGIN GENERATED status.main_results: do not edit
  …
  # END GENERATED status.main_results
```
and the same pair for `alignment.statements`. The rest of the file is hand-written,
`fidelity.divergences` included: the script changes only the lines between the markers. A file
`formalization.NAME.yaml` beside it that declares a namespace in the template's field
`alignment.namespace` has the same two regions, and the theorems of that namespace go there
instead: material kept apart from what `formalization.yaml` describes.

* `status.main_results` has one entry per theorem of `comparator.json`, in its order: `declaration`;
  `file`, the source file of its module; `sorry_count`, the number of constants in the dependency
  closure of the theorem whose own type or value uses `sorryAx`; `axioms`, the axioms it depends
  on, as `#print axioms` computes them; `comparator_config`; `statement_vocabulary`, the files
  holding the definitions its statement uses; and `literature_dependencies`, the results it assumes
  from the literature, which is empty (every main theorem is proved, and `scripts/check_axioms.lean`
  checks that it depends on no axiom beyond `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`).
  The definitions a statement uses are every definition of `Hironaka` reachable from the type of
  the theorem, following the type and value of each definition, only the type of each theorem, and
  the coercion instances declared beside them (the walk of `scripts/check_defs.lean`, one theorem at
  a time); `scripts/check_defs.lean` checks that their files are `Defs.lean` files. Reading those
  files, with Mathlib and Lean core, is enough to know what the statement means.
* `alignment.statements` has one entry per theorem: the theorems of `comparator.json`, in its
  order, then the other theorems of the library with `@[source]` tags, by file and name. An entry
  has the fields of the formalization.yaml template: `source`, the citation of the theorem's tags
  (`KEY, locator, page`, several joined by "; ") with each key written as the authors' last names
  and the year of its entry in `references.bib` (the form `scripts/check_formalization_yaml.py`
  compares with the tags: `Hironaka 1964, Main Theorem I, p. 132`); `lean`; `module`, the source
  file of its module; `status`, `proved` (for a main theorem without tags, `source` is `none (not in
  the sources)` and `status` is `proved (not in the sources)`); and `note`, the items of its
  section, each after its label, when it has any. The sections of the definitions the statements
  use are not compiled here: they are read in the docstrings and the blueprint, and listed for the
  review ledger.

`coeClasses`, `uses` and the closure in `generate` repeat the first pass of
`scripts/check_defs.lean` (scripts run by `lake lean` cannot import one another), as
`scripts/check_blueprint.lean` does, so a change to that walk is made in all three files.

## Modes

With the environment variable `FORMALIZATION_CHECK` set, the file is only compared with the result,
and elaboration fails if a generated region is out of date. With `LIST_REVIEW_ITEMS` set, nothing is
written: the script prints on standard output every compiled item as an entry of the review ledger
`blueprint/reviews.json` (the main theorems in the order of `comparator.json`, then the definitions
their statements use, by file and name),
```
{"decl": "…", "kind": "Translation", "hash": "…", "reviewer": "", "date": ""}
```
ready to paste once `reviewer` and `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) are filled in.

## The hash of an item

`hash` is 16 lowercase hexadecimal digits: the 64-bit FNV-1a hash (offset basis
`0xcbf29ce484222325`, prime `0x100000001b3`; for each byte, exclusive-or it into the state, then
multiply by the prime modulo `2^64`) of the UTF-8 bytes of the item's text after its label, with
every run of whitespace (space, tab, line feed, carriage return) replaced by one space and the
leading and trailing whitespace removed. So re-wrapping an item keeps its hash, and any other change
to its text changes it. The blueprint computes the same hash to decide whether an item has been
reviewed: an item is reviewed when the ledger has an entry with its declaration, kind and hash.
