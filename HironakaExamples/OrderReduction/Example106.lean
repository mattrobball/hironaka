# Kollár's Example 106 for the order-reduction functor: the affine space and its origin

[Kol07, Example 106] follows the principalization of the ideal `I = (x³ − y², x⁴ + xz² − w³)` of a
subvariety `X ⊂ 𝔸⁴`: `ord I = 2`, `H = (y = 0)` is a hypersurface of maximal contact, and the first
blow-up is that of the origin. This module and
`HironakaExamples/OrderReduction/Example106BlowUp.lean`, `Example106Length.lean` follow the
order-reduction functor `BO_{4,2}` of [Kol07, Theorem 103] on the triple `(𝔸⁴_ℚ, I, ∅)`. The
statements are about any smooth blow-up sequence with the three properties of the functor's values,
an order-`2` sequence ([Kol07, Definition 66]), no empty centre ([Kol07, 32]) and final maximal
order `< 2` (clause (1) of Theorem 103), through the cosupport forcing of
`HironakaExamples/Sequence/CosuppForcing.lean`: at each stage the next centre is supported at the
order-`2` locus of the current ideal. The computations are made at every scheme point of
`𝔸⁴_ℚ = Spec ℚ[x, y, z, w]`, not only at its `ℚ`-points. This module treats the first stage:

* the cosupport `{p : ord_p I ≥ 2}` is the origin alone (`two_le_ord_iff`): by the derivative
  criterion `c ≤ ord_p I ⟺ D^{c−1}(I) ⊆ 𝔭` ([Kol07, Lemma 74 (3)]) and
  `D(I) = (x², y, z², xz, w²)` (`HironakaExamples/Balanced/Example106.lean`), a prime containing
  `D(I)` contains every coordinate;
* `max-ord I ≤ 2` at every point (`maxOrd_le_two`): `D²(I) = (1)`, since `∂y/∂y = 1`;
* the reduced origin is the ideal sheaf of `(x, y, z, w)` (`vanishingIdeal_singleton_origin`):
  the maximal ideal is prime, hence radical, with support the origin;
* the forcing applied (`exists_eq_cons_specIdealSheaf_m0`): every order-`2` sequence for `(I, ∅)`
  on `𝔸⁴_ℚ` with no empty centre and final maximal order `< 2` begins with the blow-up of the
  origin, Kollár's "thus the first step is to blow up the origin in `𝔸⁴`";
* the inputs making `(𝔸⁴_ℚ, I, ∅)` a triple (`isNonzeroEverywhere_I106`, the smoothness of
  `𝔸⁴_ℚ → Spec ℚ`; the normal crossings of the empty boundary are
  `Hironaka/Scheme/Snc/EmptyFamily.lean`);
* Kollár's closing sentences as printed (`strictTransform_meets_plane_ideal`; see also
  [Kol07, Warning 23]): in the `x`-chart the strict transform `X₁ = (x₁ − y₁², x₁ + z₁² − w₁³)`
  meets the plane `(x₁ = y₁ = 0)` in the cuspidal curve `(x₁ = y₁ = z₁² − w₁³ = 0)`.

The worked example is completed in `HironakaExamples/KollarExample106Run.lean`, where these
facts are applied to the sequence produced by the functor `Hironaka.BO.data 4 2`.
