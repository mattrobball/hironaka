# The model space as an analytic manifold

`AnalyticManifold.of 𝕜 E` bundles the model space `E` itself as an analytic manifold. No statement
of a main theorem of this release uses it, and `scripts/check_defs.lean` admits in a module named
`Defs` only what some statement needs, so it is declared here, beside `Defs`, for the proofs that
use it (the monomialization of `Hironaka/Resolution/Standard/Analytic.lean`).

/-- The model space `E` itself as an analytic manifold (Mathlib's `chartedSpaceSelf` and
`instIsManifoldModelSpace`, Hausdorff and second countable by hypothesis), as `ModuleCat.of`
bundles a module. An `abbrev`, so that `↥(AnalyticManifold.of 𝕜 E) = E` reduces and an open
`W ⊆ E` is `Opens E`. A type `M` carrying Mathlib's unbundled instances of an analytic manifold
modelled on `E` (charted space, analytic manifold, Hausdorff, second countable) is bundled by the
anonymous constructor, `⟨M⟩ : AnalyticManifold 𝕜 E`; the analytic main theorems apply to it. -/
