# Total, strict and geometric strict transforms of closed subspaces

The transforms of a closed analytic subspace `X ⊆ M`, given by its ideal sheaf `I` of finite type,
under the blowing-up `π : M' → M` with centre the closed submanifold `Y` (`IsBlowUp ψ Y c π`),
exceptional divisor `F = π⁻¹(Y)` with ideal sheaf `I_F = hY.idealSheaf.pullback π h.contMDiff`,
following [BM97, §3, "The strict transform"] and [Hir64, Ch. 0, §5, p. 142].

* **The total transform** `σ⁻¹(X)`: the closed subspace of `M'` defined by
  `π⁻¹(I) = π^*I · 𝒪_{M'}`, the pull-back `I.pullback π h.contMDiff` along the blow-up (its
  points are the preimages of the points of `X`, `IdealSheaf.support_pullback`).
* **The strict transform** `X'` ([BM97, Proposition 3.13]; compare the controlled transform of a
marked ideal, [Wlo09, Definition 3.2.4, (3)]).
  Bierstone–Milman give two forms: the ideal generated at `a'` by the strict transforms
  `f' = y_exc^{-d}(f ∘ σ)` of the `f ∈ I_{σ(a')}`, and (Proposition 3.13) the saturation
  `⋃_k (I_{σ⁻¹(X)} : I_F^k)` with respect to the exceptional divisor. `strictTransformSubspace` is
  the saturation: the ideal sheaf whose stalks are
  `saturationStalk hY h I a' = ⨆ k, (π⁻¹(I)_{a'} : I_{F,a'}^k)`, taken by a classical choice when
  this stalk family has local generators (Bierstone–Milman's "`I_{X'}` is an ideal of finite type
  since `X` is locally Noetherian", proved in
  `Hironaka.Manifold.BlowUp.Transform.SaturationFiniteType`), the unit ideal sheaf otherwise,
  the pattern of the weak transform; in the first case its stalks are the saturations
  (`stalkIdeal_strictTransformSubspace_of_hasLocalGenerators`). The generated-by-strict-transforms
  form is `strictTransformElems`; that its span is contained in the saturation is immediate
  (`span_strictTransformElems_le_saturationStalk`, one direction of Proposition 3.13); the other
  direction is proved in `Hironaka.Manifold.BlowUp.Transform.StrictSubspaceProp313`.
* **The geometric strict transform** `X''` ([BM97, Remarks 1.7, (2)] and [BM97, Remark 3.15]):
  the smallest closed subspace of `σ⁻¹(X)` containing the set `|σ⁻¹(X)| ∖ |F|`; in ideal-sheaf
  terms the largest ideal sheaf `J ≥ π⁻¹(I)` whose cosupport contains that set
  (`geometricCandidates`; `geometricStrictTransform` is the greatest element, by a classical
  choice, the unit ideal sheaf if there is none). The total transform is a
  candidate, and the strict transform is one as soon as its stalks are the saturation
  (`strictTransform_mem_geometricCandidates_of_hasLocalGenerators`), which gives `X'' ⊆ X'`.

Conventions: ideal sheaves are ordered by inclusion of stalk ideals, so `X' ⊆ σ⁻¹(X)` reads
`π⁻¹(I) ≤ I_{X'}`; `⊤` is the empty subspace. The strict transform of the centre itself is empty
(the saturation of `I_F` is `⊤`).
