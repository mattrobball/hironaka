# The subspace predicates on analytic manifolds: elementary facts

The elementary facts about the predicates of Hironaka's Definitions 1 and 2 on the ideal sheaves of
an analytic manifold — `IsInvertible`, `IsReduced`, `IsNonsingular`, `IsIrreducible`,
`HasOnlyNormalCrossingsWith`, `HasOnlyNormalCrossings`, `IsNormalCrossingsDivisor` — and the reduced
transform `IdealSheaf.reducedTransform`: the two branches of the reduced transform and its set of
points (`f⁻¹(E) ∪ f⁻¹(D)` on either branch, [Hir64, Main Theorem II'(N) (iii), p. 156]); the ideal
sheaf of a closed submanifold defines a non-singular subspace — its quotient stalks are the stalks
of the submanifold (`Hironaka/Manifold/Submanifold/Ideal.lean`), regular local rings
(`Hironaka/Manifold/Germ/StalkNoetherian.lean`) — hence the centre of every monoidal transformation
is non-singular (Bierstone–Milman's blowing-up has a closed submanifold as centre,
[BM88, Definition 4.1]); a non-singular subspace is reduced (a regular local ring is a domain, so
the stalks are prime); an irreducible subspace is nonempty; and the reduced transform is natural
along a square of analytic isomorphisms, the compatibility of the boundary with local isomorphisms
that the functoriality of the resolution needs.
