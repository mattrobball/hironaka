# Resolution of a variety by a single blow-up, in Mathlib's terms

Hironaka's Main Theorem I [Hir64, p. 132] (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isBlowUpAlong_smooth`): an
integral scheme `X`, separated and of finite type over a field `k` of characteristic zero, has a
blow-up `π : X' → X` along an ideal sheaf supported exactly on the singular locus, with `X'` smooth
over `k`; `π` is proper and an isomorphism over the smooth locus of `X`. It is stated with Mathlib's
definitions and two that Mathlib lacks, effective Cartier ideal sheaves and blow-ups given by their
universal property, defined from Mathlib's alone (`Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsEffectiveCartierIdeal`,
`Scheme.Hom.IsBlowUpAlong`, in `Hironaka.Scheme.BlowUp.BlowUpAlong.Defs`, a module importing Mathlib
only), so that the challenge file `Challenge/Standard.lean` imports Mathlib only and repeats the two
definitions word for word. They are the library's `Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsInvertible` and
`IsBlowUp` (`Scheme.Hom.isBlowUpAlong_iff_isBlowUp`).

It is the library's Main Theorem I,
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_support_eq_singularLocus_isRegular_blowUp`, for `X` with its structure
morphism as an algebraic `k`-scheme, read in Mathlib's terms: the resolution is the blow-up
`D.blowUp → X` along an ideal sheaf `D` supported on the singular locus, which has the universal
property of the blow-up (`Scheme.IdealSheafData.blowUp.isBlowUp`, read through
`Scheme.Hom.isBlowUpAlong_iff_isBlowUp`). It is proper because `X` is locally Noetherian
(`Scheme.IdealSheafData.blowUp.isProper_π`) and an isomorphism over the complement of the support of
`D` (`Scheme.IdealSheafData.blowUp.isIso_π_restrict_compl_support`), which is the smooth locus of
`X` since over the perfect field `k` the singular locus is the complement of the smooth locus
(`Scheme.singularLocus_eq_compl_smoothLocus`, [Sta, Tag 00TV]); and `D.blowUp` is regular, hence
smooth over `k` (`Scheme.smooth_iff_isRegular`).

/-- **Resolution of singularities** [Hir64, Main Theorem I, p. 132]. Every integral scheme `X`,
separated and of finite type over a field `k` of characteristic zero, is resolved by a single
blow-up: there is a blow-up `π : X' → X` along an ideal sheaf supported exactly on the singular
locus of `X`, with `X'` smooth over `k`. In particular `π` is proper and an isomorphism over the
smooth locus.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** Hironaka's "non-singular" (every local ring regular) is read as smooth over `k`,
  `Smooth (π ≫ f)`, and his singular locus as the complement of the smooth locus `f.smoothLocus`:
  for schemes locally of finite type over a field of characteristic zero the two notions agree
  [Sta, Tag 00TV].
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "say reduced and irreducible" is read as the hypothesis
  `IsIntegral X`. -/
