# Hironaka's Main Theorem II″(N) on the model manifold

The conclusion of Hironaka's Main Theorem II′(N) [Hir64, p. 156], which II″(N) [Hir64, pp. 158–159]
asserts for real spaces, for a non-singular real or complex analytic manifold modelled on `𝕜ⁿ` with
a normal crossings divisor and a coherent sheaf of nonzero ideals, with its clauses (i)–(iv):
properness of the blow-down and, over every compact `K`, on the finite succession over `nhd K`, (i)
every centre is non-singular, (ii) the order of the weak transform of `𝓘|_{nhd K}` is a positive
constant on each centre, (iii) each boundary is a simple normal crossing family having simple normal
crossings with its centre (the `IsSncBoundaryWith` form of "only normal crossings with"), (iv) the
last boundary is a simple normal crossing family and the last weak transform is the unit ideal. It
is proved here for the glued blow-down of the resolution family `resolveFam bo T` along the
exhaustion of a manifold `M` modelled on `𝕜ⁿ`, stated on the extension-compatible family
`resolveFamExt bo T` (`Wlo09/FamilyExt.lean`). Kollár's form is [Kol07, Theorem 68] with [Kol07,
Remark 67]; Włodarczyk's is [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3 (1), (2), (4)] with the reduction of the maximal
order in [Wlo09, §6, Step 2a]. The theorem is the input of the main theorem
`exists_extensionCompatibleFamily_weakTransformSeq_eq_top` at the end of this file, which transports
it along the chart isomorphism of the boundary of an arbitrary real analytic manifold.

## The proof

`σ` is proper because over each piece of the exhaustion it is a finite composite of blow-ups and
properness is local on the target (`isProperMap_resolveFamExt_map`); over `nhd K` the succession
`seq K` is the value of `resolveFam` there, whose centres are closed submanifolds, hence
non-singular (clause (i), `FiniteSuccession.center_isNonsingular`); whose weak transforms of
`𝓘|_{nhd K}` have order exactly the round's mark along the centres ([Kol07, Remark 67] read
backwards, `Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/HironakaClauses.lean`; clause (ii),
`resolveSeqOn_clause_ii`); whose boundaries are the ideal sheaves of the total transforms of the
simple normal crossing boundary family `T.F|_{nhd K}`, themselves simple normal crossing families
for the standard model and having simple normal crossings with the centre of their stage (clause
(3′) of [Kol07, Definition 66]; `isSnc_totalTransformSeqFrom_and_boundarySeq_eq_of_forall_lt` fed by
`isOfOrderGe_zero_resolveSeqOn`, with `center_resolveSeqOn_hasSncWith` and the boundary identified
through `restrictTriple_F_idealSheaf`; clause (iii) and the first half of (iv), with the codimension
`codim i` of the centre); and whose last weak transform is the unit ideal (the last round at mark
`1`, `ord_lt`; the second half of (iv), `weakTransformSeq_last_resolveSeqOn_eq_top`).

(`isProperMap_resolveFamExt_map`) and, over every compact `K`, clauses (i), (ii) and the second half
of (iv) by the per-open theorems of `Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/HironakaClauses.lean` at

conclusion of II′(N) (p. 156), without Hironaka's assumption that `X` admit a projective morphism
to a complex Stein space. -/

/-- **Hironaka's Main Theorem II″(N)** for real-analytic manifolds [Hir64, Main Theorem II″(N),
pp. 158–159], whose conclusion is that of Main Theorem II′(N), p. 156, in the compatible-family form
of Włodarczyk's locally finite principalization [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3 (1) and (4)]. Let `X` be a
real-analytic manifold, `E₀` an ideal sheaf on `X` with only normal crossings (`IsSncBoundary`), and
`J₀` an ideal sheaf on `X` with nonzero stalks. Then there is a proper analytic map `σ : X̃ → X`
which over an open neighbourhood `U_K` of every compact `K ⊆ X` splits, compatibly across compacts
(`ExtensionCompatibleFamily`), into a finite succession of monoidal transformations
`U_K = U_0 ← U_1 ← ⋯ ← U_r` with centres `D_i ⊆ U_i` such that, for every compact `K`,
* (i) every centre `D_i` is non-singular;
* (ii) the order of the weak transform `J_i` of `J₀|_{U_K}` is a positive constant along `D_i`
  (`FiniteSuccession.HasConstantPositiveOrderAlongCenters`);
* (iii) with `E_0 = E₀|_{U_K}` and `E_{i+1} = red(σ_{i+1}⁻¹(E_i) ∪ σ_{i+1}⁻¹(D_i))`, every `E_i` has
  only normal crossings with `D_i`, and, the first half of (iv), `E_r` has only normal crossings
  (`FiniteSuccession.HasSncBoundaries`);
* the second half of (iv): `J_r = 𝒪_{U_r}`, the unit ideal sheaf `⊤`.

The constant of (ii) may depend on `K` and `i`. Clause (i) holds for every finite succession
(`FiniteSuccession.center_isNonsingular`); it is kept as Hironaka's (i). For `J₀ = 𝒪_X` the weak
transforms are the unit ideal, of order `0` everywhere, so (ii) leaves every centre empty, and `σ`
is then an isomorphism.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `F : ExtensionCompatibleFamily X` with `F.map` is the pair $(\tilde X, \sigma)$;
  `F.nhd K` is $U_K$ and `F.seq K` the finite succession over it;
  `(F.seq K).weakTransformSeq (J₀.restrict (F.nhd K)) i` is $J_i$ and
  `(F.seq K).boundarySeq (E₀.restrict (F.nhd K)) i` is $E_i$.
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "has only normal crossings" for the boundary is read on his global
  irreducible components [Hir64, Definition 2, p. 141], that is, as simple normal crossings in the
  sense of [Kol07, Definition 24] (`IsSncBoundary`, `IsSncBoundaryWith`).
* **Translation.** A real-analytic manifold, `X : AnalyticManifold ℝ E`, is Hironaka's non-singular
  analytic $\mathbb{R}$-space.
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "coherent sheaf of non-zero ideals" is read as a locally finitely
  generated ideal sheaf (`IdealSheaf X`, coherent by Oka's theorem) with nonzero stalks (`hJ₀`).
* **Gap.** Hironaka's succession is one locally finite succession
  $\{f_\lambda : X_{\lambda+1} \to X_\lambda\}$ of $X$ itself, indexed by a countable well-ordered
  set $\Lambda$ with maximal element $\gamma$ (projective limits at the elements without
  predecessor) [Hir64, p. 155], whose canonical modification $X_\gamma \to X$ he notes is proper (p.
  155, after Main Theorem I′(n)). Here it is replaced by a finite succession
  $U_0 \leftarrow \cdots \leftarrow U_r$ (`F.seq K`) over a neighbourhood $U_K$ (`F.nhd K`) of each
  compact $K$, compatible across compacts, and the proper map $\sigma$ (`F.map`). Restricting
  Hironaka's succession over $U_K$ gives such a family (by local finiteness only finitely many
  centres meet the preimage of $U_K$); the compatible family is not asserted to come from one
  succession of $X$. Włodarczyk's "locally finite" is the compatible-family form itself.
* **Gap.** Clause (i) asserts non-singularity only, and a centre may be empty or have several
  components. Hironaka's irreducibility of the centres is not asserted per compact: Włodarczyk's
  centres are disjoint unions of smooth centres [Wlo09, Definition 3.2.4], and the irreducible
  refinement of the succession over a smaller compact is in general not the restriction of the
  succession over a larger one, which [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3 (4)] requires.
* **Strengthening.** In clause (iii) `IsSncBoundaryWith` also asserts that $E_i$ has only normal
  crossings at every point, which Hironaka's "with $D_i$" [Hir64, Definition 2, p. 141] does not; he
  derives it from (iii) (the remark after Main Theorem II, p. 143), and it is [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3
  (2)].
* **Gap.** Hironaka's $X$ is any non-singular analytic $\mathbb{R}$-space; II″(N) does not fix its
  dimension (the "of dimension $N$" is in II′(N), p. 156). Here `X` has one model space `E`, so it
  is pure-dimensional; a non-singular space whose components have different dimensions is the
  disjoint union of its pure-dimensional open and closed parts, to each of which the theorem
  applies. No finite-dimensionality of `E` is assumed: the coordinates `E ≃ ℝⁿ` that `hE₀` provides
  make `E` finite-dimensional.
* **Restatement.** The reducedness and invertibility of `E₀`, which Hironaka assumes ("reduced
  analytic subspace everywhere of codimension one"), are not separate hypotheses: both follow from
  the family of smooth hypersurfaces with simple normal crossings that `hE₀` provides, whose reduced
  ideal sheaf is `E₀`. -/
