# Włodarczyk's locally finite embedded desingularization

The analytic embedded desingularization of a reduced closed subspace `Y` of an analytic manifold
`M` over `𝕜 = ℝ` or `ℂ` [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.2], as one extension-compatible family over `M`,
with its exceptional divisor and strict transform on the glued space and its commutation with
local analytic isomorphisms and with closed embeddings of ambient manifolds (his clause (4)): the
main theorem `AnalyticManifold.exists_embeddedDesingularization` at the end of this file.

On the standard model `𝕜ⁿ` the family is `embeddedDesingFam`
(`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/EmbeddedDesingModel.lean`): the concrete embedded
desingularization functor `concreteBEDanFamStar` at the triple `(M, 𝓘_Y, ∅)` of `𝓘_Y` made the
unit ideal on the connected components of `M` where it vanishes, glued along the exhaustion of
`M`; its blow-down is proper and an isomorphism off `Sing(Y)`, over every compact the succession
desingularizes `Y` (`isDesingularizedBy_embeddedDesingFam`), and it commutes with local analytic
isomorphisms over every pair of compacts (`isPullbackUpToEmptyAlong_embeddedDesingFam`). Its
exceptional divisor `E` and strict transform `Ỹ` on the glued space are the glued objects of
`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/EmbeddedDesingGlobal.lean`
(`isGloballyDesingularizedBy_embeddedDesingFam`), and altogether the family is a locally finite
embedded desingularization of `Y` (`isLocallyFinitelyDesingularizedBy_embeddedDesingFam`).

On an arbitrary model `E` the assignment `embeddedDesingAssignment 𝕜 E` reads the value on the
re-modelled manifold back along `E ≃ 𝕜ⁿ` (`ExtensionCompatibleFamily.transportBack`), with the
clauses (`isAnalyticIsoOver_compl_sing_map_transportBack_iff`,
`isDesingularizedBy_seq_transportBack`, `isGloballyDesingularizedBy_transportBack`,
`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/ModelTransport/Family.lean`) and the pull-back relation along the
re-modelled local isomorphism (`IsPullbackUpToEmptyAlong.transportAlong`), as the functorial
principalization does (`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/FunctorialPrincipalization.lean`).
The commutation with closed embeddings of ambient manifolds
(`commutesWithClosedEmbeddings_embeddedDesingAssignment`) likewise carries the push-forward
relation on the standard models (`isPushforwardUpToEmptyAlong_embeddedDesingFam`,
`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/EmbeddedDesingPushforward.lean`) back along the
identifications of the two models (`IsPushforwardUpToEmptyAlong.transportAlong`), the embedding
re-modelled between them (`transportBetween`).

/-- **Włodarczyk's locally finite embedded desingularization** [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.2], over
`𝕜 = ℝ` or `𝕜 = ℂ`, with its commutation with local analytic isomorphisms and with closed
embeddings of ambient manifolds. There is a compatible family assignment `R` on the embedded pairs
`(M, Y)` of an analytic manifold `M` over `𝕜`, modelled on a finite-dimensional space, and a
reduced closed analytic subspace `Y ⊆ M` with ideal sheaf `I_Y`
(`CompatibleFamilyAssignment (EmbeddedPair 𝕜)`) — to each pair an analytic map `res_{Y,M} : M̃ → M`
which over an open neighbourhood `U_K` of every compact `K ⊆ M` splits, compatibly across
compacts, into a finite succession of blow-ups `U_K = U_0 ← U_1 ← ⋯ ← U_r` with smooth closed
centres `C_i ⊆ U_i` and composite `σ_K : U_r → U_K` — such that
* every value `R(M, Y)` is a locally finite embedded desingularization of `Y`
  (`IdealSheaf.IsLocallyFinitelyDesingularizedBy`): `res_{Y,M}` is proper and an isomorphism off
  the singular locus `Sing(Y) = Y ∖ Reg(Y)`; over every compact the succession satisfies (1)–(3)
  and (6) (`IdealSheaf.IsDesingularizedBy`), has no empty centre, and has every centre of
  codimension at least two or of codimension one inside the exceptional divisor of its stage; and
  `M̃` carries a divisor `E` and a strict transform `Ỹ` restricting to `E_r` and `Y_r` over every
  compact, with (1), (3) and (6) on `M̃`;
* (4) `R` commutes with local analytic isomorphisms
  (`EmbeddedPair.CommutesWithLocalAnalyticIsomorphisms`): for a local analytic isomorphism
  `g : N → M` of manifolds modelled on one space and compacts `K' ⊆ N`, `K ⊆ M` with
  `g(U_{K'}) ⊆ U_K`, the succession of `R(N, g^{-1}(Y))` (`EmbeddedPair.pullback`) over `U_{K'}`
  is the pull-back along `g` of the succession of `R(M, Y)` over `U_K`, up to blow-ups with empty
  centre (`FiniteSuccession.IsPullbackUpToEmptyAlong`; [Wlo09, Theorem 3.5.1 (2)]);
* (4) `R` commutes with closed embeddings of ambient manifolds
  (`EmbeddedPair.CommutesWithClosedEmbeddings`): for a closed embedding of analytic manifolds
  `τ : N → M` (an analytic embedding with closed image) along which `I_Y` is the push-forward of
  `I_{Y'}` (`IdealSheaf.IsPushforwardAlong`: `τ(N)` contains `Y`, and `Y' = τ^{-1}(Y)`), no
  connected component of `N` lying in `Y'`, and compacts `K' ⊆ N`, `K ⊆ M` with
  `τ(U_{K'}) ⊆ U_K`, the succession of `R(M, Y)` over `U_K` is the push-forward along `τ` of that
  of `R(N, Y')` over `U_{K'}`, up to blow-ups whose centres lie outside the part over `τ(U_{K'})`
  (`FiniteSuccession.IsPushforwardUpToEmptyAlong`; [Kol07, 34.3]).

Włodarczyk's (5), that the factorization over a larger compact restricts to the factorization over
a smaller one, is the compatibility of the family: the succession over `K ⊆ K'`, restricted to
`U_K`, is an extension of that over `K` (`ExtensionCompatibleFamily.isExtensionOf_restrict`;
[Wlo09, Definition 3.2.6]).

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `R` is Włodarczyk's embedded desingularization as a rule on all pairs $(M, Y)$,
  the morphism $\mathrm{res}$ of his clause (4): `T.Y.IsLocallyFinitelyDesingularizedBy (R T)` is
  his conclusion for the embedded pair `T = (M, Y)`, with `(R T).map` his $\mathrm{res}_{Y,M}$.
  `I.regularLocus` is his $\operatorname{Reg}(Y)$, the points at which the local ring
  $\mathcal{O}_{M,x}/I_x$ of $Y$ is regular, and
  `((R T).seq K).strictTransformSubspaceSeq (I.restrict ((R T).nhd K)) i` is $Y_i$.
* **Restatement.** Włodarczyk's divisor $E$ and strict transform $\tilde Y$ on $\tilde M$ are the
  `E` and `Y` of `exists_divisor_strictTransform`: on the last stage
  $U_r \cong \mathrm{res}_{Y,M}^{-1}(U_K)$ over every compact (`(R T).toSpace K`) they are $E_r$
  and $Y_r$, and his clauses (1), (3) and (6) are asserted on $\tilde M$ and on every $U_r$. The
  support identity $|E| = \mathrm{res}_{Y,M}^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} Y)$ and the smoothness of
  $\tilde Y$ are stated on every $U_r$ only, from which they follow on $\tilde M$
  (`IdealSheaf.IsGloballyDesingularizedBy.support_eq`,
  `IdealSheaf.IsGloballyDesingularizedBy.isNonsingular`).
* **Strengthening.** That $\mathrm{res}_{Y,M}$ is an isomorphism over
  $M \setminus \operatorname{Sing}(Y)$, whose preimage is, over each $U_K$, the complement of the
  simple normal crossings divisor $E_r$, hence dense, says more than Włodarczyk's "bimeromorphic".
  Over $\operatorname{Reg}(Y)$ it follows from his clause (2); over $M \setminus Y$ it is not in
  Theorem 2.0.2 but holds for his construction, an initial segment of the principalization of
  $I_Y$, which is an isomorphism over $M \setminus V(I_Y)$ [Wlo09, Lemma 4.0.3].
* **Interpretation.** His "the support of the divisor $E$ is the exceptional locus of
  $\mathrm{res}_{Y,M}$" is read as $|E_r| = \sigma_K^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} Y)$ for every
  compact $K$.
* **Interpretation.** Clauses (3) and (6) are read at each point: "has only simple normal crossings
  with the exceptional divisor $E_r$", said of $\tilde Y$, with the codimension of $\tilde Y$ read
  at each point and transversally (`IsSncBoundaryTransversalTo`); in
  $\sigma^*(I_Y) = I_{\tilde Y} I_{\tilde E}$, $\tilde E$ near a point is a combination of the
  components of $E_r$ through it, rather than "a locally finite combination of the irreducible
  components of the divisor $E_{U_r}$".
* **Correction.** The hypothesis that $Y$ is reduced (`isReduced`) is tacit in the source:
  Włodarczyk's $Y$ is "an analytic subspace", but the algebraic original of clause (6) assumes "a
  reduced closed subscheme" [Wlo05, Theorem 4.7.1], and his conclusion fails for the double line
  $Y = V(x^2) \subset \mathbb{K}^2$. His centres have codimension at least two
  [Wlo09, Remark (2) after Theorem 2.0.3], so their images in $\mathbb{K}^2$ form a closed
  discrete set $P$, $\sigma$ is an isomorphism over $\mathbb{K}^2 \setminus P$, and no component
  of $E_r$ meets the preimage $\tilde p$ of a point $p$ of the line off $P$. By (6),
  $I_{\tilde Y, \tilde p} = (x^2)$: either $\tilde Y$ has the non-regular local ring
  $\mathcal{O}/(x^2)$, against (3), or, read as reduced, $I_{\tilde Y} = (x)$ and (6) fails. The
  same argument, with images of dimension at most $\dim M - 2$, applies whenever $Y$ is
  generically non-reduced along a component of dimension $\dim M - 1$. Blowing up the line
  itself, a formal codimension-one blow-up of his Remark (1), would satisfy (3) and (6) with
  $\tilde Y = \emptyset$, but this is excluded by his Remark (2) and by "the support of the
  divisor $E$ is the exceptional locus".
* **Gap.** Non-reduced subspaces with no generically non-reduced component of dimension
  $\dim M - 1$ are not covered: those with embedded components, such as
  $V(x^2, xy) \subset \mathbb{K}^2$, and those generically non-reduced only along components of
  codimension at least two, such as $V(x^2, y) \subset \mathbb{K}^3$. The counterexample does
  not apply to them.
* **Interpretation.** Włodarczyk's manifold `M` is read as pure-dimensional: local analytic
  isomorphisms relate manifolds modelled on one space and closed embeddings manifolds modelled on
  two, so the embedded pairs carry their model space and `R` is one assignment over all
  finite-dimensional model spaces.
* **Strengthening.** The factorization is indexed by the compacts `K` of `M`, not only by
  Włodarczyk's compact sets $Z \subset Y$, with $K \subseteq U_K$ made explicit.
* **Gap.** The commutation with local analytic isomorphisms is stated over every pair of compact
  sets only. The lift of $g \colon N \to M$ to a map $\tilde N \to \tilde M$ identifying
  $\tilde N$ with $N \times_M \tilde M$, which the principalization theorem states, is not stated
  here, and with it the global content of the exact equality for a surjective $g$
  [Wlo09, Theorem 3.5.1 (1)], which has no counterpart per pair of compact sets.
* **Translation.** "Embeddings of ambient varieties" in clause (4) is read as Kollár's commutation
  with closed embeddings [Kol07, 34.3] over every pair of compact sets, as the last sentence of
  [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3] is, the stages of the succession over $N$ embedding over $\tau$ into
  those of the succession over $M$.
* **Restatement.** That clause is asserted when no connected component of $N$ lies in $Y$,
  Kollár's "$0 \neq I_Y$": on such a component the embedded desingularization of $Y \subseteq N$
  is trivial, while that of $Y \subseteq M$ may blow up centres on it where other components of
  $Y$ meet it.
* **Strengthening.** Each centre has a single codimension.
* **Translation.** That no centre is empty is the first half of Włodarczyk's Remark (2) after
  Theorem 2.0.3, in the empty blow-up convention of [Kol07, 32]. The codimension clause reads its
  second half, centres of codimension at least two, with his Remark (1), that the blow-up of a
  centre of codimension one is an isomorphism making it a component of the exceptional divisor: a
  centre of codimension one lies in the exceptional divisor already. No centre has codimension
  zero, since the centres lie over $\operatorname{Sing}(Y)$, which for a reduced $Y$ contains no
  smooth hypersurface germ, and no open set.
* **Gap.** Centres of codimension one are not removed from the successions. Deleting their steps
  would leave $\mathrm{res}_{Y,M}$, the exceptional divisors and the strict transforms unchanged
  (the equation of such a centre is a nonzerodivisor modulo the strict transform at that stage),
  but a centre of codimension one of a submanifold $N$ of positive codimension pushes forward to
  a centre of codimension at least two of $M$, so the deletion is incompatible with the
  commutation with closed embeddings in its push-forward form. Włodarczyk notes that such blow-ups
  "may occur for some marked ideals induced on subvarieties of ambient varieties" and "determine
  blow-ups of ambient varieties which are not isomorphisms" [Wlo09, Remark after Lemma 5.3.7]. -/
