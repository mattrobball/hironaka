# The vanishing stalk of a preimage along a local analytic isomorphism, for charted types

`vanishingStalk_preimage_of_isLocalDiffeomorphAt` of
`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Functor/PullbackTransport.lean` is stated for bundled analytic
manifolds and an `AnalyticMap`; here the same statements are proved for a bare analytic map
between charted types (`[IsManifold 𝓘(𝕜, E) ω M]` alone, no Hausdorff or second-countability
assumptions): a germ vanishes on `h⁻¹(Z)` at `b` iff its push-forward along the local inverse
vanishes on `Z` at `h b` (`Germ.vanishesOn_compTendsto_of_isLocalDiffeomorphAt'`), and
`vanishingStalk (h ⁻¹' Z) b = Ideal.map (germMap h hh b) (vanishingStalk Z (h b))`
(`vanishingStalk_preimage_of_isLocalDiffeomorphAt'`, through the bijective germ map
`germMap_bijective_of_isLocalDiffeomorphAt`). The proofs are those of the bundled lemmas. Off the
centre of a blowing-up the map is a local analytic isomorphism (condition (1) of
[BM88, Definition 4.1]) and the strict transforms are the preimages of the components, so the
vanishing stalks upstairs are transports of the vanishing stalks downstairs; this is used in the
Jacobian bookkeeping of the `Hironaka` library (`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/BM97/LedgerStep.lean`,
`Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/ModelTransport/Square.lean`).
