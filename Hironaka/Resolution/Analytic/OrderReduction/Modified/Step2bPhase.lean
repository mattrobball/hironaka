# The monomial phase at the mark `1`, by recursion

The monomial phase of the modified algorithm [Wlo09, Theorem 7.4.1] resolves `(M(𝓘), 1)` by the
sequence of blow-ups of [Wlo09, §6, Step 2b] at `µ = 1`: while some member carries a component of
positive exponent, blow up the positive locus of the latest-born such member (`Step2bCenter.lean`)
and carry the triple along (`Step2bStep.lean`). This module defines the sequence **by recursion on a
fuel `k`**: `step2bPhase k T hT` is the list of the first `k` steps, stopping early (the empty list)
once no member is active, and proves the properties which hold for every fuel: no empty centre
([Kol07, 32]; the centre is nonempty by construction), the order clause of [Kol07, Definition 66]
at the mark `1`, the length bound and the recursion equations. The fuel is a device of the
definition: the termination of the phase, i.e. that the fuel `Σ_D a_D` over the components exhausts
the active members (the invariant of [Wlo09, §6, Step 2b] decreases), is the theorem
`step2bPhase_eq_of_step2bMeasure_le` of `Step2bMeasure.lean`, and the value on a relatively compact
open is read at that fuel (`Step2bFamily.lean`).

The rule is intrinsic (the latest-born active member, in the order of birth along the total
transforms), so the phase is canonical.
