# The Jacobian clause on the glued blow-down

For the glued blow-down `σ : M̃ → M` of the resolution family `resolveFam bo T`, on the
extension-compatible family `resolveFamExt bo T` (`Wlo09/FamilyExt.lean`), the product of the
Jacobian ideal of `σ` with `σ⁻¹(𝓘)` is the ideal sheaf of a normal-crossings divisor
(`resolveFamExt_jacobianIdeal_mul_pullback_isNormalCrossingsDivisor`): the remark after
[BM97, Theorem 1.10], that if `J` is the ideal generated locally by the Jacobian determinant of
the composite of the blowings-up then `J · σ⁻¹(𝓘)` is a normal-crossings divisor. It is the input
of Bierstone–Milman's principalization theorem with the Jacobian clause, the main theorem
`exists_extensionCompatibleFamily_isNormalCrossingsDivisor_jacobianIdeal_mul_pullback` at the end
of this file, which transports the clauses on the model, together with those of Main Theorem
II″(N) for the empty boundary (`resolveFamExt_mainTheoremIIpp`), to an arbitrary real-analytic
manifold.

* On a piece `U` (the relatively compact opens of the exhaustion,
  `resolveSeqOn_jacobianIdeal_mul_pullback_composite_isNormalCrossingsDivisor`): the Jacobian ideal
  of the composite blow-down of `resolveSeqOn bo T U hU` is a monomial in the exceptional family at
  every point (`jacobianLedger_composite_of_forall_hasSncWith`,
  `Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/BM97/LedgerSequence.lean`, its hypothesis that the centres have
  simple normal crossings with the boundary being the corollary `center_resolveSeqOn_hasSncWith` of
  clause (3′) of the value) and the pull-back of `𝓘|_U` is a boundary monomial
  (`pullbackIsMonomialAtLast_resolveSeqOn`, `Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/Wlo09/Monomial.lean`); the
  product of two monomials of one simple normal crossing family is a normal-crossings divisor
  (`isNormalCrossingsDivisor_jacobianIdeal_mul_of_forall_monomial`,
  `Principalization/JacobianMonomial.lean`).
* On `M̃` (`resolveFamExt_jacobianIdeal_mul_pullback_isNormalCrossingsDivisor`): every point is
  `ι_m q` (`toLimit_surjective`); the stalk of `J · σ⁻¹(𝓘)` at `ι_m q` is carried by the germ
  isomorphism of
  `ι_m` onto the piece's stalk (the Jacobian factor by
  `CompatibleFamily.jacobianStalk_limitBlowDown_toLimitMap`,
  `Hironaka/Resolution/Analytic/BM97/LedgerLimit.lean`; the pull-back factor by `pullback_comp` and
  `limitDesc_comp_toLimitMap`), and the normal-crossings form is transported back along the local
  diffeomorphism `ι_m` (`exists_monomial_of_comap_of_isLocalDiffeomorphAt`).
* `resolveFamExt_comap_map_isNormalCrossingsDivisor`: `σ⁻¹(𝓘)` alone is the ideal sheaf of a
  normal-crossings divisor ([Kol07, Theorem 35 (2)]; [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3 (3)];
  [BM97, Theorem 1.10]), the gluing tool
  `CompatibleFamily.isNormalCrossingsDivisor_comap_limitBlowDown` fed on each piece by
  `resolveSeqOn_comap_last_isNormalCrossingsDivisor`; this is the form the main theorems use.

/-- **Real-analytic principalization with the Jacobian clause** [BM97, Theorem 1.10 and the
sentence following it], in the compatible-family form of [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3 (1), (2) and (4)].
Let `M` be a real-analytic manifold modelled on a finite-dimensional real vector space and `I` an
ideal sheaf on `M` with nonzero stalks. Then there is a proper analytic map `σ : M̃ → M` which over
an open neighbourhood `U_K` of every compact `K ⊆ M` splits, compatibly across compacts
(`ExtensionCompatibleFamily`), into a finite succession of monoidal transformations
`U_K = U_0 ← ⋯ ← U_r` with centres `D_i`, such that
* for every compact `K`: every centre `D_i` is smooth; the exceptional divisors `E_i`, the
  boundaries started at the empty boundary `E_0 = ⊤`, have simple normal crossings with the centres,
  and the last one `E_r` has simple normal crossings (`FiniteSuccession.HasSncBoundaries`); and the
  weak transform of `I|_{U_K}` on `U_r` is the unit ideal sheaf;
* the pull-back `σ*(I)` is a normal-crossings divisor (`IdealSheaf.IsNormalCrossingsDivisor`);
* the product of the Jacobian ideal of `σ` (`AnalyticMap.jacobianIdeal`: the ideal sheaf generated
  locally, in analytic coordinates, by the Jacobian determinant of `σ`) with `σ*(I)` is a
  normal-crossings divisor;
* `σ` is an analytic isomorphism over the complement of the support of `I`
  (`AnalyticMap.IsIsoOver`), the support being Kollár's cosupport `cosupp I`
  [Kol07, Theorem 21 (2)].

The clauses on the successions are stated over each compact; the normal-crossings, Jacobian and
isomorphism clauses, being local on `M̃`, are stated on `σ` itself. For `I = 𝒪_M` the support of
`I` is empty, so `σ` is an isomorphism by the last clause.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `I.pullback F.map F.map.contMDiff` is Bierstone–Milman's
  $\sigma^{-1}(I) = \sigma^*(I) \cdot \mathcal{O}_{M_k}$, and
  `F.map.jacobianIdeal * I.pullback F.map F.map.contMDiff` their $\mathcal{J} \cdot \sigma^{-1}(I)$,
  $\mathcal{J}$ the ideal generated by the Jacobian determinant of $\sigma$;
  `(F.seq K).weakTransformSeq (I.restrict (F.nhd K)) (Fin.last _) = ⊤` is their
  $I_k = \mathcal{O}_{M_k}$; `(F.seq K).HasSncBoundaries ⊤` is the clause on the exceptional
  divisors $E_j$, `⊤` being the empty boundary; and `F.map.IsIsoOver I.supportᶜ` says that
  $\sigma$ is an isomorphism over the complement of the support of $I$.
* **Interpretation.** Bierstone–Milman's "smooth $\mathrm{inv}_I$-admissible centres" are read as
  smooth centres having simple normal crossings with the exceptional divisor accumulated so far; the
  invariant $\mathrm{inv}_I$ does not appear in the statement.
* **Correction.** The hypothesis that `I` has nonzero stalks (`hI`) is tacit in the source: without
  it $\sigma^*(I)$ could not be a divisor. Kollár's principalization states it explicitly, for an
  ideal sheaf "not zero on any irreducible component" [Kol07, Theorem 35].
* **Strengthening.** Bierstone–Milman's finite sequence of blow-ups, for a quasi-compact $|M|$, is
  here a finite succession over a neighbourhood of every compact, compatible across compacts: for a
  manifold that is not quasi-compact the finite sequence is replaced by a locally finite one, by
  analogy with the remark after [BM97, Theorem 1.6], which is made for Theorem 1.6 only. For a
  compact `M` the family contains one finite succession over `M`.
* **Strengthening.** That the last exceptional divisor $E_r$ has simple normal crossings (in
  `HasSncBoundaries`) is not a clause of [BM97, Theorem 1.10]: it is their remark that admissibility
  "guarantees that $E_{i+1}$ is a collection of smooth hypersurfaces having only normal crossings"
  [BM97, after (1.2)], and [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3 (2)] at $i = r$.
* **Strengthening.** The clause that $\sigma$ is an isomorphism over the complement of the support
  of $I$ (`F.map.IsIsoOver I.supportᶜ`) is not in [BM97, Theorem 1.10] or [Wlo09, Theorem 2.0.3]; it
  is [Wlo09, Lemma 4.0.3], cf. [Kol07, Theorem 35 (3)]. -/
