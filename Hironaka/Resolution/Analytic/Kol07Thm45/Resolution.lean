# The resolution of an analytic space: gluing over an exhaustion, and the value off the class

Włodarczyk defines the canonical desingularization of an analytic space `Y` by gluing: for an
open cover `{U_i}` of `Y` with compact closures `Z_i := Ū_i`, let `des_i : Ỹ_{Z_i} → Y_{Z_i}` be the
canonical desingularization of the germ `Y_{Z_i}` and `Ũ_i := des_i⁻¹(U_i) → U_i` its restriction;
`Ỹ` is the manifold obtained by gluing the `Ũ_i` along the `Ũ_ij`, and `des : Ỹ → Y` is a proper
bimeromorphic morphism [Wlo09, §4.3]; the desingularization of a germ commutes with local
analytic isomorphisms [Wlo09, §4, (3)⇒(4)]. Kollár observes that a resolution functor on
neighbourhoods of compact sets that commutes with open embeddings yields a resolution of every
analytic space that is an increasing union of compact subsets [Kol07, 44], which is his
Theorem 45 [Kol07, Theorem 45]. The cover is taken here as an EXHAUSTION `U_0 ⋐ U_1 ⋐ ⋯`,
`⋃ U_n = X` (an analytic space is countable at infinity and locally compact Hausdorff,
[Hir64, Ch. 0, §1, p. 120]), interchangeable with Włodarczyk's locally finite cover. For an
embedded desingularization functor `bed : BEDanFamStar 𝕜`:

* `BEDanFamStar.ExhaustionGluing bed X`: the gluing datum — an exhaustion `U_n` of `X` by
  relatively compact opens, local embedding data `D_n` over each `U_n` with a gluing datum each
  (`PieceGlue.lean`), and a `GlueOver` of the pieces `resolutionOn (D n) bed` (the
  `Ũ_n := des_n⁻¹(U_n)`, indexed by `ULift ℕ` for the universe of the gluing construction) over
  `X` along the overlaps `U_n ∩ U_m` — the transitions are the open embeddings `R(U_n) ↪ R(U_m)`
  between the resolutions over nested members (`resolutionOn_indep` in `GluingProperties.lean`:
  an open embedding of germs extends to an open embedding of desingularizations,
  [Wlo09, §4, (3)⇒(4)]), the cocycle identity by their uniqueness, and the glued space is Hausdorff
  by the closed-graph criterion; its existence for reduced `X` under `hbed : bed.IsEmbeddedDesing`
  is `resolutionGlues_of_isEmbeddedDesing` (`GluingProperties.lean`), the proposition being
  `BEDanFamStar.ResolutionGlues bed X := Nonempty (ExhaustionGluing bed X)`;
* `BEDanFamStar.resolutionPair bed X`: for reduced `X` with a gluing datum the glued space with
  its descended map, otherwise the pair `⟨X, 𝟙 X⟩` — the value OFF THE CLASS of reduced spaces (the
  assignment `ResolutionAssignment.space` of the resolution theorem `exists_functorial_resolution`
  is defined on every analytic space while its clauses are stated for reduced ones; compare
  `Hironaka.Resolution.BR_eq_nil_of_not_class` for the algebraic functor) as the outer `if`, and
  the fallback for a missing gluing datum (never taken under `hbed`) as the inner one;
* `BEDanFamStar.resolution bed X : AnalyticSpace 𝕜` (`R(X)`) and
  `BEDanFamStar.resolutionMap bed X : resolution bed X ⟶ X` (`Π_X`); `bed` first, so that
  `bed.resolution : AnalyticSpace 𝕜 → AnalyticSpace 𝕜` is the field `space` of a
  `ResolutionAssignment` and `bed.resolutionMap` its `map`. Unfolding lemmas for every branch:
  `resolutionPair_eq_of_glues`, `resolutionPair_eq_of_not_glues`,
  `resolutionPair_eq_of_not_isReduced`, `resolution_eq_of_not_isReduced`,
  `resolutionMap_heq_of_not_isReduced`.

`resolution bed X` is a `K`-space glued with open-embedding transitions; it is a different
construction from the charted manifold `limitManifold` of a compatible family of successions, which
is used for the resolution of manifolds. `hbed` binds no definition.
