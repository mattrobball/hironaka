# The partner of a member of an exceptional family across a gluing transition

Across the transition `ψ : (R i)|_{glueOpens i j} ≅ (R j)|_{glueOpens j i}` of a gluing datum
(`GlueOver`, `Hironaka.AnalyticSpace.Glue.Over`), the members of two simple-normal-crossings
families `H₁`, `H₂` of closed subspaces of the pieces (`ClosedSubspace.IsSncFamily`,
`Hironaka.AnalyticSpace.SncFamily`) are matched by a label `e : Λ₁ → Λ₂`. In the resolution of an
analytic space the label is the stage of the blow-up sequence at which a member is created: the
blow-up sequences of two pieces have the same centres on the overlap at every stage [Kol07,
Proposition 37, (37.2)], so the exceptional divisors created at one stage correspond. Given the
labelled identity locally, an open subset around every point on which the pull-back along `ψ` of the
trace of `H₂ (e σ)` is the trace of `H₁ σ`, it holds on the whole gluing open subset
(`comap_restrict_eq_of_forall_exists_local`: equality of closed subspaces is stalkwise), and for a
member with non-empty trace the partner `e σ` is the unique member of `H₂` whose pull-back is that
trace (`existsUnique_partner_of_forall_exists_local_label`), because two members of a
simple-normal-crossings family with the same stalk ideal at a common point of their supports are the
same member (`IsSncFamily.eq_of_stalkIdeal_eq_of_mem_support`): the chart at the point assigns each
member through it one parameter of a regular system of parameters, distinct members distinct
parameters, and two parameters of a regular system generating the same principal ideal coincide,
their classes in `𝔪/𝔪²` being linearly independent over the residue field
(`IsRegularLocalRing.index_eq_of_span_singleton_eq_of_span_range_eq`, from
`IsRegularLocalRing.linearIndependent_toCotangent_of_span_eq` of
`Hironaka.Algebra.RegularSmooth.ParameterCount`).

A label-free local correspondence does not determine the partner when members are disconnected: for
four disjoint lines `A, A', B, B'` and the families `H₁ = {A ∪ B, A' ∪ B'}`,
`H₂ = {A ∪ B', A' ∪ B}`, the local correspondences match `A ∪ B` to `A ∪ B'` near `A` and to
`A' ∪ B` near `B`. Hence the partner is read as the label.

The two statements about a gluing datum have no code users outside this module: the chain form of
`Hironaka.Resolution.Analytic.Kol07Thm45.Glue.OverFamilyChain` restates them in the `restrictOpen`
spelling of the traces (`ClosedSubspace.comap_eq_of_forall_exists_local`,
`existsUnique_comap_eq_of_forall_exists_local`), which is what the gluing along an exhaustion uses.
The rigidity lemma `IsSncFamily.eq_of_stalkIdeal_eq_of_mem_support` is used there too.
