# Monomials of an snc family are ideal sheaves of snc divisors

[Kol07, Theorem 35 (2)] says that `Π^* I` is "the ideal sheaf of a simple normal crossing divisor";
the predicate `IsIdealOfSncDivisor` asks for an snc family `F` and exponents `a` with
`I = ∏_j (F^j)^{a_j}`. The fine monomial `E.monomial a` of
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.MarkedOrderReduction.MonomialPart` ([Kol07, Definition–Lemma 110]
read on the irreducible components) carries one exponent per irreducible component of the members of
`E`; this module realises it as an `IsIdealOfSncDivisor` through **the component family** of `E` —
the family of all irreducible components of all members, indexed by (member, generic point) in the
lexicographic order — which is snc when `E` is ([Kol07, Definition 24]: "each `E^i` is smooth"; a
member may have several irreducible components, [Kol07, Notation 64 (3)]: "Each `E^i` is allowed to
be reducible or empty", and the sentence after [Kol07, Definition–Lemma 110]): a component has the
stalk of its member at each of its points (`stalkIdeal_componentFamily_eq` of
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Kol07.ComponentwiseBlowUp`), two components of one member never meet
(`eq_of_mem_support_componentFamily`), so the coordinates of `IsSncAt` are those of `E`. This is how
the principalization theorem's clause (2) is verified for the monomial ideal left at the end of
Kollár's order reduction.

* `DivisorFamily.components`, `components_component`, `support_components_component_le`;
* `DivisorFamily.monomial_eq_prod_components`: `E.monomial a = ∏_p (component p)^{a p}`;
* `Snc.isSnc_components`, `Snc.isIdealOfSncDivisor_monomial`;
* `IsIdealOfSncDivisor.comap_of_smooth`: the property pulls back along smooth morphisms
  (`isSnc_comap_of_smooth` of `Hironaka.Scheme.BlowUpSequence.PullbackSnc`; `comap` is
  multiplicative).
