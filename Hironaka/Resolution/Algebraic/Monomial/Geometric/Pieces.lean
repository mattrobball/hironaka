# Piece families: the geometric state of the monomial procedure

Kollár's Step 3 ([Kol07, 111, Step 3]) runs on the combinatorial state of
`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/Monomial/State.lean`. Its realisation on a scheme carries a *labelled
piece family* along the run: for each component index `c < nextComp` a closed set `piece c` of the
ambient scheme (a nonempty disjoint union of irreducible components of the member `E^{label c}`, or
empty when the component is dead), its label (the index of its member through an order
isomorphism `E.ι ≃o Fin nextLabel`) and its exponent. At the input the pieces are the
irreducible components of the members (`ofDivisorFamily`); after the blow-up of a centre `S` (a
finset of faces) the old pieces become their strict transforms and each face `P ∈ S`
contributes one new piece `π⁻¹(Z_P)` under the new label, Kollár's new divisor put last
([Kol07, Definition 65]): one smooth, possibly reducible, divisor per blow-up, its irreducible
components pairwise disjoint and carrying the common exponent `a(P) − m`. A "component" of the
state is therefore an irreducible component at the input only. This is what makes the nerve
transition an equality: for `E⁰ = V(y)` and `E¹ = V(y − x² + 1)` in `𝔸²` the face `{E⁰, E¹}`
has a disconnected centre (two points) and a reducible exceptional divisor, and tracking its
two components separately would break the correspondence with the combinatorial rule. Not in
the sources in this form.

* `PieceFamily`: the data; `faceSet` (the intersection of the pieces of a face), `nerve` (the
  nonempty faces below `nextComp` with nonempty intersection), `IsValid n m` (the invariants
  of the combinatorial state for the family's data, discharged from the geometric hypotheses in
  `Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/Monomial/Geometric/Nerve.lean`), `toState n m hV` (the
  combinatorial state; every data field is the family's, definitionally).
* `faceIdeal`, `centerOf`: the ideal sheaves of `Z_P = ⋂_{c ∈ P} piece c` and
  `Z_S = ⋃_{P ∈ S} Z_P`.
* `newComp`, `blowUpPieces`: the transition, the strict transforms of the old pieces and
  `π⁻¹(Z_P)` for the new piece of `P`, with labels and exponents by the formulas of the
  combinatorial transition, so that `toState (Φ.blowUpPieces S m) = (toState Φ).blowUp S` is a
  literal equality once the nerves agree (`toState_blowUpPieces_of_nerve_eq`; the nerves agree
  by `nerve_blowUpPieces` of `Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/Monomial/Geometric/Kernel.lean`).
* `exponentAt`, `faceAt`: the exponent function of the marked monomial ideal
  `E.monomial Φ.exponentAt` (`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/MarkedOrderReduction/MonomialPart.lean`)
  and the face of the pieces through a point.
* `Realizes E e`: the piece family realises the boundary `E`, each member being the disjoint
  union of its pieces.
* `RefinesAlong`, `restrictNerve`, `restrictState`: the refinement relation along a morphism
  `h : Y ⟶ X` and the state restricted to the faces meeting the image of `h`, the geometric
  forms of `Refines` and `Sub` of `Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/Monomial/Restrict.lean`.
* `Components`, `ofDivisorFamily`: the input piece family (the irreducible components).
* `extendIso`: the label isomorphism extended along the index type of the total transform.
* `realizeAux`, `stagePieces`, `realize`: the fold of a list of centres (the combinatorial run
  `(step3 st).2`) into a blow-up sequence, carrying the piece family; `realize` is the
  geometric Step 3, the third step of `BMO_{n,m}`
  (`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/MarkedOrderReduction/Step3Input.lean`).
