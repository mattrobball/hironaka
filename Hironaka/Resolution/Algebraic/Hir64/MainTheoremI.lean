# Hironaka's Main Theorem I and its weak form

Hironaka's Main Theorem I [Hir64, Main Theorem I, p. 132]: for `X` a reduced irreducible algebraic
`k`-scheme, `k` of characteristic zero, there is a closed subscheme `D` of `X` whose set of points
is exactly the singular locus and whose monoidal transformation (the blow-up of `X` in `D`) is
non-singular. It is derived from Kollár's functorial resolution [Kol07, Theorem 36]: the sequence
`BR X` of the resolution functor (`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Kol07.Thm36.BR`) is a finite
succession of blow-ups of `X` with smooth last stage (clause (1)) whose centres lie over `Sing X` (a
property of the construction, stronger than clause (2), an isomorphism over the smooth locus, proved
below). The enlargement of the centre (`exists_center_support_eq_singularLocus`,
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Hir64.SingleCenter`; Hironaka's remark [Hir64, pp. 132–133] that a
finite succession of monoidal transformations is one monoidal transformation with a suitably chosen
centre) then produces ONE centre `D` with `|D| = Sing X` and `D.blowUp` non-singular.

**The centres lie over the singular locus** (`stageMap_mem_singularLocus_of_mem_center_BR`; the
argument of [Kol07, 4.2] and of the proof of [Kol07, Theorem 27]: a functorial resolution is an
isomorphism over the smooth points, read through the clauses). Let `z` be a point of the centre
`Z_i` of `BR X` and suppose `x := Π_i z` is a smooth point. Take a member `U` of the finite affine
cover of `X` through `x` (the cover of [Kol07, Proposition 37, proof]): `U` is integral and
affine, an algebraic `k`-scheme through `U → X → Spec k`, so a class member
(`isReducedEquidimensional_of_isIntegral`). Clause (4a)
(`BR_pullback_smooth_of_class`) for the open immersion `U → X` gives
`BR U = ((BR X).pullback (U → X)).eraseEmpty`, and on the integral affine `U` the resolution is
the embedding-free affine resolution `BR_affine' k U` with its empty blow-ups deleted
(`BR_eq_BR_affine'_of_integral`), that is, the restriction to `U` of a truncated run of `BP` on an
admissible embedding `emb : U → A` (`exists_admissibleEmbedding`). The point `z` transports along
the flat pullback (`exists_restrictedCenterHasPointOver_pullback_iff`), across the deletions of
empty blow-ups (`exists_restrictedCenterHasPointOver_bot_eraseEmpty_iff`) and along the closed
immersion (`restrictedCenterHasPointOver_iff_of_isClosedImmersion`) to a centre of the `BP` run
with a point over `emb x`, `x` a smooth point of `U` (`Scheme.Hom.preimage_smoothLocus_eq`) —
against `not_restrictedCenterHasPointOver_BP_of_mem_smoothLocus`
(`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Kol07.Thm36.AffineTheorem36IsoSnc`): no centre of the
principalization sequence of `I_X` has a point over a smooth point of `X`.

**The single-blow-up form** (`resolution_eq_single_blowUp`): `Π : X_r → X` is one blow-up
`K.blowUp` over `X` with `|K| = ⋃ Π_i(|Z_i|) ⊆ Sing X`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_blowUp_composite_iso`: the composite of a sequence of blow-ups is a
single blow-up, the composition of blow-ups [Sta, Tag 080B] iterated).

**The theorem** (`exists_support_eq_singularLocus_isRegular_blowUp`):
`exists_center_support_eq_singularLocus` at `S := BR X`, with clause (1)
(`BR_smooth_last_of_class`) and the centres over `Sing X` as its two hypotheses. The
theorem is `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_support_eq_singularLocus_isRegular_blowUp`, below.

**The weak form** (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_dense_isIso_restrict_isRegular_blowUp`, at the
end of the file) is Hironaka's weakening of the first condition [Hir64, p. 132]: the blow-up is an
isomorphism over the complement of its centre (`blowUp.isIso_π_restrict_compl_support`), and the
complement of `Sing X` is a nonempty open of the irreducible `X`, hence dense, since the local ring
at the generic point is a field (`isRegularAt_genericPoint_of_isIntegral`).

/-- **Hironaka's Main Theorem I** [Hir64, Main Theorem I, p. 132]. Let `X` be a reduced and
irreducible (`IsIntegral`) algebraic `k`-scheme (`AlgScheme k`), `k` of characteristic zero. Then
there is a closed subscheme `D` of `X`, given by its ideal sheaf, whose set of points is exactly the
singular locus of `X` (the points whose local ring is not regular), such that the monoidal
transformation `D.blowUp` of `X` with centre `D` is non-singular. If `X` is non-singular, `D` is the
empty subscheme (`D = ⊤`) and `D.blowUpπ` is an isomorphism.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `(D.support : Set X.left) = X.left.singularLocus` is Hironaka's (i), "the set
  of points of $D$ is exactly the singular locus of $X$"; `IsRegular D.blowUp` is his (ii), the
  non-singularity of the result of the monoidal transformation of $X$ with centre $D$.
* **Interpretation.** Hironaka's "say reduced and irreducible" is read as a hypothesis
  (`IsIntegral`). His Introduction describes Main Theorem I as "the resolution of singularities of
  an arbitary [sic] reduced algebraic **B**-scheme X" [Hir64, p. 112], irreducible or not;
  reducible `X` is not covered here.
* **Out of scope.** Hironaka's strong form [Hir64, pp. 132–133], that `D.blowUpπ` is the composite
  of a finite succession of monoidal transformations whose centres $D_i$ are non-singular (a),
  contain no simple point of $X_i$ (b), and along which $X_i$ is normally flat (c), and Main Theorem
  I*: both rest on the Hilbert–Samuel function and normal flatness, whereas the library follows the
  route through the order of an ideal and hypersurfaces of maximal contact, as in Włodarczyk's and
  Kollár's proofs. The statement here is Main Theorem I as printed. -/

Let `X` be a reduced and irreducible (`IsIntegral`) algebraic `k`-scheme (`AlgScheme k`), `k` of
characteristic zero. Then there is a closed subscheme `D` of `X` whose open complement `U` is dense
in `X`, such that the monoidal transformation `f : D.blowUp → X` with centre `D` restricts to an
isomorphism `f⁻¹(U) → U` and `D.blowUp` is non-singular.

Density of `U` excludes `D = X`.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `D.support.compl` is the open complement $U = X \setminus D$, and
  `IsIso (D.blowUpπ ∣_ U)` says that the restriction $f^{-1}(U) \to U$ of the projection
  `D.blowUpπ` over $U$ is an isomorphism.
