# Włodarczyk's embedded desingularization sequence `BED`

The sequence of blow-ups of Włodarczyk's embedded desingularization theorem with smooth centres
[Wlo05, Theorem 1.0.2], in the strengthened form of Bravo–Villamayor [Wlo05, Theorem 4.7.1]: for a
reduced closed subscheme `Y = ⋃ Yᵢ` of a smooth variety `X`, a sequence of blow-ups in smooth
centres after which the strict transforms `Ỹᵢ` of the components are smooth and disjoint, and the
full transform of `I_Y` is its monomial part times `I_Ỹ`. Włodarczyk's proof runs the canonical
resolution of the marked ideal `(X, I_Y, ∅, 1)` [Wlo05, 4.6] with a modification: the procedure
is run until "the strict transform of one of the components `Yᵢ` is the center"; at that moment,
by the Claim of the proof of Theorem 4.7.1, the controlled transform of
`(I_Y, 1)` agrees with `I_Ỹᵢ` near `Ỹᵢ`; these strict transforms are isolated, the procedure
continues "ignoring these isolated components", and at the end any components not meeting the
strict transforms are principalized.

Kollár's blow-up sequence functors expose neither Włodarczyk's invariant nor his "moment", so the
modification is transcribed as an outer loop around the order reduction functor `BMO_1` of
[Kol07, Theorem 69] (`Hironaka.Stage.BMO_m`): run `BMO_1` on the marked triple; at the first stage
whose centre contains the strict transform of one of the components not yet isolated, truncate
the run before that blow-up, replace the ideal by its colon by the reduced ideal of the absorbed
strict transforms (the isolation), and restart on the modified marked triple with the remaining
components. Włodarczyk's reordering of the monomial part (his Step 2b, which terminates by his
invariant) is not transcribed; the stop rule alone is. Włodarczyk's Claim fails for this
order of the steps (`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Wlo05.EmbeddedHypotheses`), and the clauses of
the theorem are instead proved from the local form of the ideal near an isolated component
(`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Wlo05.EmbeddedChainRelative` and the modules `EmbeddedCP*`).

## The construction

* `bmoOneRun T hm` — the run of `BMO_1` on a marked triple `T` of mark `1`; it is a smooth
  blow-up sequence of order `≥ 1` for `T` (`isOrderGeSeq_bmoOneRun`).
* `HasAbsorptionAt T hm C n` — the stop rule: at stage `n` of the run the centre CONTAINS the
  strict transform of some member of the finite set `C` of (the strict transforms of) the
  components not yet isolated (`CenterContains`; Kollár's "some blow-up center must contain
  `η_X`" in the proof of [Kol07, Corollary 22]). Stage `0` is "before the first blow-up of the
  round".
* `stageTriple T hm n` — the marked triple induced at stage `n` of the run truncated there
  (`MarkedTriple.induced`; a prefix of a sequence of order `≥ 1` is one). `isolatedTriple T hm C n`
  — that triple with its ideal replaced by the colon `I_n : I_Γ`, `I_Γ` the REDUCED ideal of the
  union of the absorbed strict transforms: `I : I_Γ` is `𝒪` near `Γ` where `I = I_Γ`, and `I`
  away from `Γ`; it is canonical, with no choice of a neighbourhood. `remainingComponents T hm C n`
  — the strict transforms of the other members of `C` at stage `n`. Both are the constructions
  `isolatedAt` and `remainingAt` for an arbitrary run and arbitrary absorbed and remaining families,
  at the truncated run.
* `bedAux T hm C` — the loop: run `BMO_1` on `T`; if some stage has an absorption, take the FIRST
  such stage `n₀` (`Nat.find`), truncate the run BEFORE the absorbing blow-up (`take n₀`), isolate,
  and recurse on the isolated triple with the remaining components (well-founded on the number of
  remaining components, the absorbed set being nonempty); if no stage has one, the round is the
  whole run and the loop stops. The restart on the modified marked triple IS the definition: no
  stability property of Kollár's functors is assumed, and the exhaustiveness "every remaining
  component is eventually absorbed" ([Wlo05, 4.6]: otherwise the generic points would be
  transformed isomorphically) is a theorem about this object, not a clause of it.
* `BED T` — Włodarczyk's embedded desingularization sequence of the triple `T = (X, I_Y, E)`: the
  loop from the marked triple `(X, I_Y, 1, E)` with the components of `V(I_Y)` (their reduced
  ideals, `componentIdeals`). The theorem concerns `E = ∅` and reduced `Y`; the definition needs
  neither.

## Where the stop happens

At mark `1` every absorption of a strict transform happens in the `d = 1` round of Step 1 of
[Kol07, Theorem 107] (`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.MarkedOrderReduction.Step1NonmonomialPart`),
inside Step 2.2 of [Kol07, Theorem 103] (the modules `Hironaka.OrderReduction.Step22*`: Lemma 102 at
the position of the maximal-contact hypersurface), and at the bottom of the maximal-contact chain it
is the opening trivial blow-up `π_{-1}` of [Kol07, Lemma 102]
(`Hironaka.BD.piMinusOne`) of the hypersurface `Ỹ_c ⊂ H_{r-1}`, pushed
forward through the chain. The strict transform of the absorbed component along that blow-up is
EMPTY (`strictTransformAlong` saturates by the exceptional ideal, which is the component's own
ideal), so the stop is what keeps `Ỹ` alive: Włodarczyk's termination in his Step 1ba is "no
`π_{-1}` at a maximal-contact position", and the truncation before the absorbing blow-up is exactly
that.

The clauses of [Wlo05, Theorem 1.0.2] for `BED` — smooth centres and the simple normal crossing
clauses, the centres disjoint from the smooth points of `Y`, the final strict transform smooth and
snc with the boundary, the fine form of the full transform, and the behaviour under smooth
morphisms of the ambient — are proved in the modules
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Wlo05.Embedded*`, collected for the functor `EDFunctor` in
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Wlo05.EmbeddedFunctorClauses`, and stated as the theorem
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_functorial_embeddedDesingularization` at the end of that module.
