# The resolution of an embedded affine scheme

Kollár constructs the resolution `BR(X)` of an affine scheme `X` from a closed embedding `X ↪ A`
into a smooth affine scheme with `dim A ≥ dim X + 2` and the principalization sequence
`BP(A, I_X, ∅)` of the ideal of `X` [Kol07, Theorem 36, first paragraph of the proof]. The proof
of [Kol07, Corollary 22] says how: since `I_X` is not locally principal at the generic point
`η_X` of `X`, some centre of `BP(A, I_X, ∅)` contains `η_X`; for the first such index `j` the
composite `π_0 ⋯ π_{j-1}` is a local isomorphism near `η_X`, `η_X` is the generic point of the
centre `Z_j`, and `π_0 ⋯ π_{j-1} : Z_j → X̄` is the resolution. As [Kol07, Warning 23] remarks,
this exhibits the resolution as the composite of the blow-ups of `X` with centres `Z_i ∩ X_i`,
`i < j`, that is, as the restriction of the truncated sequence to the closed subscheme `X` in the
sense of [Kol07, Definition 30, 30.2], realised here as the pullback of the sequence along the
closed immersion (the stage embeddings `X_i ↪ A_i` are closed immersions with kernel the strict
transform of `X`).

## Main definitions

* `CenterContains S I n`: the centre at position `n` of the blow-up sequence `S` contains the
  strict transform of `V(I)` at that stage, as closed subschemes of the stage.
* `firstCenterIndex S I`: the first index `j` at which the centre of `S` contains the strict
  transform of `V(I)`, or `S.length` if there is none.
* `BR_affine TA emb`: for a triple `TA = (A, I_X, ∅)` and a closed immersion `emb : X ⟶ A`, the
  restriction to `X` of the first `firstCenterIndex (BP TA) TA.I` steps of `BP TA`.

## Conventions

The truncation is essential. Restricting the whole sequence to `X` would give an empty end
result: at step `j` the centre contains the strict transform `X̄_j` of `X`, so the restricted
centre is all of `X̄_j`, and the strict transform of `X̄_j` under its own blow-up is empty, whereas
Kollár's `BR(X)` stops at `j` with end result `X̄_j`. The hypotheses under which `BR_affine`
realises clauses (1)–(3) of [Kol07, Theorem 36] (`X` integral, `E = ∅`, `I_X = ker emb`,
codimension `≥ 2` at the generic point) are the hypotheses of the theorems that establish those
clauses for it later in this directory; the definition itself needs none of them.
