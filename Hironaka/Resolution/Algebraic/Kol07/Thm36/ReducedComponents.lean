# The irreducible components of a reduced Noetherian scheme

Facts about an irreducible component `C` of a reduced Noetherian scheme `X`, used by the resolution
functor of [Kol07, Theorem 36] on reduced equidimensional schemes, where the components may meet.
Mathlib's open neighbourhood `X.irreducibleComponentOpen C`, the complement of the other
components, is a nonempty open subscheme contained in `C` with closure `C`, hence integral
(`isIntegral_irreducibleComponentOpen_of_isReduced`); its generic point is a generic point of `C`
and lies in the smooth locus of `X` over a perfect field (`exists_isGenericPoint_mem_smoothLocus`);
the reduced closed subscheme `X.irreducibleComponentIdeal C` of `C` is integral
(`isIntegral_irreducibleComponent_of_isReduced`), and so is its push-forward along a closed
immersion (`isIntegral_subscheme_map_irreducibleComponentIdeal_of_isReduced`); the
generic point of `C` pushed along a closed immersion is a generic point of the pushed subscheme
(`isGenericPoint_map_irreducibleComponentIdeal`); and a flat morphism sends the generic point of a
component to the generic point of the component containing its image (`map_genericPoint_eq_of_flat`,
`comap_irreducibleComponentIdeal_le`). No disjointness of the components is assumed.

Mathlib's `irreducibleComponentIdeal C` is the kernel of the inclusion of the open neighbourhood,
so its reducedness is that of a scheme-theoretic image: the kernel of a morphism from a reduced
scheme is radical (`radical_ker_eq_self`), so the image is reduced (`isReduced_image`).

/-! ### The scheme-theoretic image of a reduced scheme is reduced -/

/-- The kernel of a morphism from a reduced scheme is radical: its radical has, on every affine
open `U`, an ideal contained in the radical of `ker (f.app U)`, which is `ker (f.app U)` itself
since the sections of the reduced source form a reduced ring, and the kernel is the largest ideal
sheaf below these kernels (`Scheme.IdealSheafData.le_ofIdeals_iff`). -/
