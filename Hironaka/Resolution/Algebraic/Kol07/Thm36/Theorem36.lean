# Kollár's Theorems 36 and 27: functorial and strong resolution

The functorial resolution theorem (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_functorial_resolution`, at the end of
this file) is stated on the category `AlgebraicGeometry.ReducedEquidimensionalScheme k`
(`Hironaka.Scheme.Resolution.Defs`), the full subcategory of the algebraic `k`-schemes `X` with
`X.left.IsReducedEquidimensional k`: the reduced algebraic `k`-schemes whose smooth locus over `k`
has one relative dimension — Kollár's standing convention that his schemes are equidimensional
[Kol07, Notation 64], as a hypothesis; the irreducible components may meet. The proof works on
the underlying schemes of the inputs, the membership being `X.property`: clauses (1)–(3) are
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Kol07.Thm36.Theorem36Assembly`, the change of fields (4b) is
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Kol07.Thm36.BaseChangeAffine`, and the two statements of the
smooth-morphism clause (4a) [Kol07, 34.1] are derived here: a smooth `k`-morphism `h : Y ⟶ X`
between class members has the constant relative dimension `dY - dX`
(`smoothOfRelativeDimension_sub_of_smoothLocus`,
`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Kol07.Thm36.RelativeDimensionConstancy`), and at that dimension the
versions of (4a) taking the relative dimension as an input (`BR_eq_eraseEmpty_pullback_of_smooth`,
`BRAffine_eq_eraseEmpty_pullback_of_smooth`) give `BR_pullback_smooth_of_class` and
`BRAffine_pullback_smooth_of_class`: for surjective `h` the resolution of `Y` is the pullback of
the resolution of `X`, and in general it is the pullback with its empty blow-ups deleted.

Kollár's strong resolution [Kol07, Theorem 27] (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_strong_resolution`)
follows, at the end of the file, by applying the functorial resolution to an integral algebraic
`k`-scheme, a class member (`isReducedEquidimensional_of_isIntegral`); so does Hironaka's Main
Theorem I (`Hironaka.Resolution.Algebraic.Hir64.MainTheoremI`).

/-- **Kollár's functorial resolution** [Kol07, Theorem 36]. There is a family `BR` of blow-up
sequence functors on reduced equidimensional algebraic `k`-schemes (`BlowUpSequenceFunctor
(ReducedEquidimensionalScheme k)`), one for each field `k` of characteristic zero, such that
* every value `BR(X)`, with composite `Π : X_r → X`, is a strong resolution of `X` [Kol07, (3)]
  (`BlowUpSequence.IsStrongResolution`): `Π` is projective and birational, and (1) `X_r` is smooth
  over `k`; (2) `Π` is an isomorphism over the smooth locus `X^{ns}`; (3) `Π⁻¹(Sing X)` is the
  support of a simple normal crossing divisor;
* (4) `BR` commutes with smooth morphisms [Kol07, 34.1] (`CommutesWithSmoothMorphisms`) and with
  change of fields [Kol07, 34.2] (`CommutesWithChangeOfFields`).

A smooth equidimensional scheme is an input, and `Π` may then be the identity. The irreducible
components of an input may meet: the two axes `xy = 0` in the plane are an input.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `(X.left ↘ Spec (.of k)).smoothLocus`, Mathlib's `smoothLocus` of the structure
  morphism, is Kollár's $X^{ns}$, and its complement is $\operatorname{Sing} X$; over a field of
  characteristic zero it is the set of points with regular local ring
  (`Scheme.mem_smoothLocus_iff_isRegularAt`).
* **Interpretation.** Kollár's clause (3), "$\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$ is a divisor with
  simple normal crossings", is read with the reduced structure on $\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$:
  it is `IsSncDivisor` of that set of points.
* **Gap.** Kollár states the theorem for all schemes of finite type over `k`. The inputs here
  (`ReducedEquidimensionalScheme`) are the reduced, equidimensional ones
  (`Scheme.IsReducedEquidimensional`), whose irreducible components may meet; the non-reduced
  schemes and the schemes with components of different dimensions are excluded, and (4) is asserted
  only between inputs. Kollár proves the theorem by feeding triples in the sense of
  [Kol07, Notation 64] (smooth equidimensional ambient schemes) to Theorem 35, and the construction
  here needs both restrictions: for a non-reduced `X` the strict transform at which the run is
  truncated need not be reduced; for components of different dimensions (4) fails. For `X` the
  cuspidal curve `y² = x³`, `Y = X ⊔ (X × 𝔸¹)` and the smooth surjection `h = 𝟙 ⊔ pr₁`, the run on
  an embedding of `Y` first blows up only the cusp line of the second piece, where the order is `2`,
  whereas `h^* BR(X)` first blows up the preimage of the cusp point, which contains the cusp point
  of the first piece. Kollár's remark that 34.1 is a local property is where a proof for mixed
  dimensions would be needed; none is printed.
* **Restatement.** Kollár's clauses (1)–(3) for the blow-up sequence $BR(X)$ are stated as
  `IsStrongResolution`, which also asks that $\Pi$ be projective and birational: a strong
  resolution in the sense of [Kol07, (3)], as the sentence introducing the theorem says ("we obtain
  strong and functorial resolution"). Both follow from the other clauses: the composite of a
  succession of blow-ups of a Noetherian scheme is projective, and by (2) $\Pi$ is an isomorphism
  over the smooth locus, which is dense.
* **Formalisation note.** The class of inputs is stable under change of fields and under étale
  `k`-morphisms, so (4) covers the base change of every input along every field extension and
  every étale morphism to an input: over a field of characteristic zero a reduced scheme of finite
  type is geometrically reduced [Sta, Tag 020I], smoothness is stable under base change
  [Sta, Tag 01VB] and fpqc local on the base [Sta, Tag 02VL], an étale morphism has reduced source
  when its target is reduced [Sta, Tag 033B], and smoothness descends along smooth surjections
  [Sta, Tag 02K5]. These stability facts are not formalized: applying (4) to a given base change
  requires showing that it is an input. -/

/-- **Kollár's strong resolution of singularities** [Kol07, Theorem 27]. Let `X` be a variety (an
integral algebraic `k`-scheme) over a field `k` of characteristic zero. Then there is a birational
and projective morphism `Π : X' → X`, the composite `S.composite` of a succession of blow-ups `S`
of `X`, that is a strong resolution of `X` (`BlowUpSequence.IsStrongResolution`): (1) `X'` is
smooth over `k`; (2) `Π` is an isomorphism over the smooth locus `X^{ns}`; (3) `Π⁻¹(Sing X)` is
the support of a simple normal crossing divisor. Projectivity and birationality are part of
`BlowUpSequence.IsResolution`; birationality is the isomorphism over a dense open subset of `X`,
here the smooth locus.

This is resolution of singularities in its usual form: a smooth `X'` with a projective birational
morphism to `X`, here a succession of blow-ups. Kollár's weaker form [Kol07, Corollary 22], a
smooth `X'` with a birational projective morphism to `X` and no conditions (2) and (3), is the part
`BlowUpSequence.IsResolution` of the conclusion.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** Kollár's variety is an integral algebraic `k`-scheme, `X : AlgScheme k` with
  `[IsIntegral X.left]`.
* **Translation.** Kollár's "birational and projective morphism" is the projectivity
  (`IsProjective`, [Sta, Tag 01W8]) and the birationality of `BlowUpSequence.IsResolution`.
* **Interpretation.** Kollár's clause (3), "$\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$ is a divisor with
  simple normal crossing", is read with the reduced structure on $\Pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Sing} X)$,
  as in Theorem 36 (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_functorial_resolution`).
* **Strengthening.** Kollár assumes `X` quasi-projective, which his proof uses to embed `X` in a
  projective space; no such hypothesis is made here.
* **Strengthening.** Here $\Pi$ (`S.composite`) is in addition the composite of a succession of
  blow-ups of `X`, whose centres are not asserted to be smooth; Theorem 27 as printed does not say
  this. It matches Kollár's construction: his $R(X)$ is the birational transform of $X$ that is a
  centre $Z_j$ of a succession of smooth blow-ups of an ambient smooth $P$, and by restriction
  [Kol07, 30.2] his $\Pi$ is the composite of the blow-ups of the birational transforms of $X$ along
  their intersections with the earlier centres, which may be singular [Kol07, Warning 23]. -/
