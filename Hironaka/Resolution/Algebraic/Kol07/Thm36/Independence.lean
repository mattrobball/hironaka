# The resolution of an affine scheme without a chosen embedding

Once the resolution `BR(X)` of an affine scheme is known to be independent of the embedding
`X ↪ A` used to construct it [Kol07, Theorem 36, proof], it can be defined without a choice.
This file fixes the hypotheses under which Kollár's construction runs and makes that definition.

## Main definitions

* `AdmissibleEmbedding k X TA emb`: `emb : X ⟶ TA.X.left` is a closed immersion over `k` into the
  ambient of a triple `TA = (A, I_X, ∅)` with `A` affine (Kollár's "smooth affine scheme":
  smoothness is part of being a triple), empty boundary, and `I_X = ker emb`. Every use of the
  independence theorem `Hironaka.Resolution.BR_affine_indep` goes through this one predicate.
* `BR_affine' k X : BlowUpSequence X`: Kollár's `BR(X)` for a scheme `X` over `k` without a
  chosen embedding, namely `BR_affine TA emb` for a chosen admissible pair `(TA, emb)` when one
  exists (`Classical.choice`; `Hironaka.Resolution.BR_affine'_eq` shows that the value does not
  depend on the choice), and the empty sequence `nil X` otherwise.

The second branch is never reached for an affine scheme of finite type over `k`, which always
has an admissible embedding (`Hironaka.Resolution.exists_admissibleEmbedding`); the definition
is nevertheless total, so that no existence statement is built into it. The unfolding lemmas
`BR_affine'_of_pos` and `BR_affine'_of_neg` are the two branches of the `if`.

a closed immersion `emb : X ⟶ TA.X.left` over `k`, with `TA.X.left` affine, the boundary of `TA`
empty and the ideal of `TA` the kernel of `emb`. These are the hypotheses of Kollár's construction
of the resolution of an affine scheme: an embedding `X ↪ A` into a smooth affine scheme and the
blow-up sequence `BP(A, I_X, ∅)` (the proof of [Kol07, Theorem 36]). -/
