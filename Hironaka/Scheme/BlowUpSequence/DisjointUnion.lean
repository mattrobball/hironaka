# Disjoint unions of triples and the domain of a blow-up sequence functor

By [Kol07, Warning 38] the domain of a blow-up sequence functor must contain the disconnected
schemes `∐ᵢ Uᵢ`: a resolution functor on connected schemes extends to disconnected ones, a
blow-up sequence functor does not, because the order of the blow-ups on different components is
part of the output. This is expressed as a predicate on triples
(`Hironaka/Scheme/BlowUpSequence/FunctorVocabulary.lean`): `T.IsSigmaOf Ts ι` says that the cofan
`ι i : (Ts i).X.left ⟶ T.X.left` is a coproduct of schemes over
`Spec k` along which the ideal and the divisor family of `T` restrict to those of the `Ts i`, and
`Triple.ClosedUnderSigma Dom` says that the class `Dom` is closed under finite nonempty disjoint
unions. This module proves the elementary facts about these predicates.

* `isSigmaOf_single`: a triple is the disjoint union of itself along the identity: the one-object
  cofan on an isomorphism is a colimit (Mathlib's `Cofan.isColimitMkOfUnique`), and `comap` along
  the identity is the identity on ideal sheaves (Mathlib) and on divisor families
  (`DivisorFamily.comap_id`, componentwise).
* `isIso_sigmaDesc`: a cofan is a colimit iff the induced morphism from the categorical coproduct
  `∐ᵢ (Ts i).X.left` is an isomorphism (Mathlib's `Cofan.nonempty_isColimit_iff_isIso_sigmaDesc`).
* `isOpenImmersion`, `iUnion_range`, `disjoint_range`: the pieces are open, cover, and are
  pairwise disjoint. Each `ι i` factors as `Sigma.ι _ i ≫ Sigma.desc ι`, an open immersion
  (Mathlib's `sigmaOpenCover`) followed by an isomorphism; every point of `∐` is `Sigma.ι _ i z`
  for a unique `⟨i, z⟩` (Mathlib's homeomorphism `sigmaMk` with the disjoint union of the
  underlying spaces, and `sigmaι_eq_iff`), transported along the isomorphism.
* Closure of the classes that occur: affine underlying scheme (Mathlib's `IsAffine (∐ g)` for a
  finite family of affines, transported along the isomorphism; this is the domain of
  [Kol07, Proposition 37], whose proof uses that `X' = ∐ Uᵢ` is affine); `max-ord I ≤ m` (the
  domain of the order reduction functor of [Kol07, Theorem 68]: the order of `I` at a point
  `ι i z` is the order of `I|_{Uᵢ} = (Ts i).I` at `z`, since the order is invariant under open
  immersions); intersections of closed classes; and for marked triples the classes given by a
  condition on the underlying triple and the classes `T.m = m` of [Kol07, Theorem 69] (the marks
  of the pieces agree with the mark of the whole; a nonempty index type is needed here, which is
  why the nullary union is excluded from `ClosedUnderSigma`).
