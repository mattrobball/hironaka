# From formal to Zariski-local equality of ideal sheaves

Kollár's remark on Krull's intersection theorem in [Kol07, Definition 55]: in a Noetherian local
ring `(R, 𝔪)` every ideal `I` equals `∩_s (I + 𝔪^s)`, so two subschemes `Z, W ⊂ X` with the same
completion at `x` agree on an open neighbourhood `U` of `x` ("such that `Z ∩ U = W ∩ U`"). Kollár
uses it to pass from the identities (91.1′–4′) between completions to an open neighbourhood
`U(p) ∋ (p, p)` ([Kol07, 95], the proof of Theorem 92).

* `stalkIdeal_eq_of_map_adicCompletion_eq`: on a locally Noetherian scheme, two ideal sheaves with
  equal completions at `q` have equal stalks at `q`: `R → R̂` is faithfully flat for a Noetherian
  local ring, so extension of ideals to the completion is injective
  (`IsLocalRing.map_adicCompletion_injective`).
* `exists_comap_eq_of_stalkIdeal_eq`: two ideal sheaves with equal stalks at `q` agree on an open
  neighbourhood of `q`: on an affine `V ∋ q` the ideals `J(V), J'(V)` are finitely generated
  (Noetherian) and have the same localization at the prime of `q`, so they agree after inverting
  some `s ∉ 𝔭_q` (`exists_mem_map_eq_map_of_localization`, `Adapted.lean`), i.e. on the basic open
  `D(s) ∋ q`; ideal sheaves on `D(s)` are determined by their stalks (`ext_stalkIdeal`).
* `exists_comap_eq_of_map_adicCompletion_eq`: the composite, Kollár's statement.

Used to pass from the formal equivalence of two hypersurfaces of maximal contact to their
equivalence on an étale neighbourhood
(`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/MaximalContact/AgreeOnSpread.lean`).
