# The logarithmic derivative ideal sheaf: gluing, stalks, restriction, filtration

[Kol07, 87] for the sheaf `D(−log S)(I)` of
`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/Logarithmic.lean`, on a scheme `f : X ⟶ Spec k`.

* **Gluing** (`ideal_logDerivative`): for `f` locally of finite type,
  `(D(−log S)(I))(U) = D(−log S(U))(I(U))` on every affine open `U`. As for `derivative` of
  `Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/Sheaf.lean`, the family `U ↦ D(−log S(U))(I(U))` is
  compatible with restriction to basic opens (`Γ(D(s)) = Γ(U)_s`, `S(D(s)) = S(U)_s`, `I(D(s)) =
  I(U)_s`, and `D(−log S(U)_s)(I(U)_s) = D(−log S(U))(I(U))_s` by `Ideal.logDerivative_map` of
  `Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/LogarithmicLocalization.lean`, which needs `Ω_{Γ(U)/k}`
  finitely presented and `S(U)` finitely generated: `Γ(U)` is a finitely generated `k`-algebra,
  hence Noetherian), so it is itself an ideal sheaf, the largest one below it.
* **Stalks** (`stalkIdeal_logDerivative`, `stalkIdeal_logDerivativeIter`):
  `(D(−log S)(I))_x = D(−log S_x)(I_x)`, the logarithmic derivations of the stalk being the
  `k`-derivations of `𝒪_{X,x}` preserving `S_x`; the same compatibility for the localization
  `𝒪_{X,x} = Γ(U)_𝔭`.
* **Restriction** ([Kol07, (87.1)]; `logDerivativeIter_comap_subschemeι`):
  `(D^r(−log S)(I))|_S = D^r(I|_S)` as ideal sheaves on `V(S)`, for `X` smooth over `k`. Stalkwise:
  the stalk of `K.comap ι` at `z ∈ V(S)` is `ι^♯(K_{ι z})` (`stalkIdeal_comap`,
  `Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/StalkIdeal.lean`), the stalk map `𝒪_{X,ι z} → 𝒪_{V(S),z}` is
  surjective with kernel `S_{ι z}` (`ker_stalkMap_subschemeι`,
  `Hironaka/Scheme/Smooth/SubschemeStalk.lean`), `𝒪_{X,ι z}` is formally smooth over `k`
  (`formallySmooth_stalk`, `Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/StalkCoords.lean`), and the
  ring-level `Ideal.logDerivativeIter_map_of_surjective` of
  `Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/LogarithmicQuotient.lean` applies. Only the smoothness of
  `X` is used: the identity holds for every closed subscheme `S`, while Kollár states it for `S`
  smooth.
* **Filtration** ([Kol07, (87.2)]; `logDerivativeIter_derivativeIter_le`,
  `logDerivativeIter_le_derivativeIter`): `D^s(−log S)(I) ⊆ D^{s−1}(−log S)(D(I)) ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ D^s(I)`,
  from `D(−log S)(K) ⊆ D(K)` and the monotonicity of the iterates.
