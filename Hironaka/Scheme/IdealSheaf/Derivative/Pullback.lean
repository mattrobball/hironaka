# `D(f^*I) = f^*D(I)` for a smooth morphism `f`

[Kol07, Lemma 74 (4)]: "if `f : Y → X` is smooth, then `D(f^*I) = f^*(D(I))`", for `X` smooth over
the field `k`. For `fX : X ⟶ Spec k` smooth, `f : Y ⟶ X` smooth and an ideal sheaf `I` on `X`, the
derivative of the pullback ideal sheaf `I.comap f` on the `k`-scheme `Y` (structure morphism
`f ≫ fX`) is the pullback of the derivative (`Scheme.IdealSheafData.derivative_comap_of_smooth`),
and likewise for the iterates (`derivativeIter_comap_of_smooth`).

The proof is stalkwise: two ideal sheaves with the same stalks agree (`ext_stalkIdeal`,
`Hironaka/Scheme/BlowUp/Descent.lean`). At `y ∈ Y` with `x = f y`, `A = 𝒪_{X,x} → B = 𝒪_{Y,y}` the
stalk map: `D(I)_x = D(I_x)` (`stalkIdeal_derivative`,
`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/Sheaf.lean`), `(I.comap f)_y = I_x B` (`stalkIdeal_comap`,
`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/StalkIdeal.lean`), so both sides are `D(I_x B)` and `D(I_x) B`, equal by
the affine-local theorem `Ideal.derivative_map_of_formallySmooth` of
`Hironaka/Algebra/Derivative/Extension.lean`: `B` is formally smooth over `A` because the stalk maps
of a smooth morphism are formally smooth (Mathlib's smooth locus, `formallySmooth_stalkMap`), and
`Ω_{A/k}` is finite projective because `A` is a localization of a standard smooth `k`-algebra of
finite type, hence formally smooth over `k` (`formallySmooth_stalk`, so `Ω` is projective) and
essentially of finite type over `k` (`essFiniteType_stalk`, so `Ω` is finite). The `k`-algebra
structures are those induced by `fX` and `f ≫ fX` (`stalkAlgebra`,
`Hironaka/Algebra/RegularSmooth/Stalk.lean`), and `k → 𝒪_{X,x} → 𝒪_{Y,y}` is a scalar tower
(`isScalarTower_stalkAlgebra_stalkMap`).

Used for the étale equivalence and the restriction of hypersurfaces of maximal contact
(`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/MaximalContact/EtaleEquiv.lean`,
`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/MaximalContact/Restrict.lean`,
`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/Kol07/MaximalContactGlobalization.lean`), for the tuning ideal under
pull-back (`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/Tuning/Pullback.lean`), for functoriality
(`Hironaka/Resolution/Algebraic/BoundaryClearing/FunctorialityPullback.lean`) and for the change of
the base field (`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/BaseChange.lean`).
