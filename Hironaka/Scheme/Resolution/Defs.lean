# The vocabulary of the algebraic main theorems

The notions in which the algebraic main theorems are stated: Hironaka's Main Theorems II and II(N)
and Corollaries 1 and 3 [Hir64], Kollár's Theorems 35 and 36 [Kol07] and Włodarczyk's embedded
desingularization [Wlo05, Theorem 1.0.2]. The functorial theorems assert the existence of a
*blow-up sequence functor* [Kol07, Definition 31] with a property of each value and a
functoriality package [Kol07, 34]; they differ in the inputs of the functor and in the property of
the values. Hironaka's theorems assert the existence of a single succession of blow-ups with
clauses on its centres, weak transforms and boundaries.

Inputs.
* `AlgScheme k`: algebraic `k`-schemes (separated and of finite type over `Spec k`) with the
  `k`-morphisms, as Mathlib's `MorphismProperty.Over`.
* `ReducedEquidimensionalScheme k`: the full subcategory of the reduced, equidimensional algebraic
  `k`-schemes (`Scheme.IsReducedEquidimensional`), the inputs of Theorem 36.
* `Triple k`: Kollár's triples `(X, I, E)` [Kol07, Notation 64], the inputs of Theorem 35; a
  morphism is a `k`-morphism along which `I` and `E` pull back.
* `EmbeddedPair k`: a reduced closed subscheme `Y` of a smooth equidimensional algebraic
  `k`-scheme `X`, the inputs of Włodarczyk's theorem; a morphism is a `k`-morphism along which `Y`
  pulls back.
* `HasUnderlyingScheme C k`: a category `C` with a functor to `AlgScheme k`, the underlying scheme
  of an input. `HasChangeOfFields C`: for a family of such categories, one per field, the notion of
  a base change of an input along a field extension.

Blow-up sequence functors and functoriality.
* `BlowUpSequenceFunctor C`: a succession of blow-ups of the underlying scheme of every input
  [Kol07, Definition 31].
* `CommutesWithSmoothMorphisms` [Kol07, 34.1],
  `CommutesWithChangeOfFields` [Kol07, 34.2], and, for triples,
  `CommutesWithClosedEmbeddingsOfEmptyBoundary` [Kol07, 34.3 with `E = ∅`].
* For embedded pairs, `CommutesWithSmoothMorphismsMeetingComponents` [Wlo05, Theorem 1.0.2 (d)].

Properties of a succession of blow-ups.
* `BlowUpSequence.HasRegularIrreducibleCenters`, `BlowUpSequence.HasSncBoundaries` and
  `BlowUpSequence.HasConstantPositiveOrderAlongCenters`: clauses of Hironaka's Main Theorems II
  and II(N) and of his Corollary 1.
* `Scheme.IsSncDivisor`: a closed set is the support of a simple normal crossing divisor.
* `BlowUpSequence.IsResolution` [Kol07, (2)] and `BlowUpSequence.IsStrongResolution`
  [Kol07, (3); Theorem 36 (1)–(3)].
* `BlowUpSequence.HasSmoothSncCenters` and `Triple.IsPrincipalizedBy`
  [Kol07, Theorem 35 (1)–(3)].
* `EmbeddedPair.IsDesingularizedBy` [Wlo05, Theorem 1.0.2 (a)–(c), (e)].

/-! ### Algebraic `k`-schemes -/

/-- The category of algebraic `k`-schemes, the schemes separated and of finite type over
`Spec k`, with the `k`-morphisms: Mathlib's `MorphismProperty.Over`. An object `X` has the
underlying scheme `X.left` and the structure morphism `X.hom : X.left ⟶ Spec k`; a morphism
`h : Y ⟶ X` has the underlying morphism of schemes `h.left`.

Relation to the source.
* **Translation.** `X : AlgScheme k` is Hironaka's algebraic $B$-scheme over the field $B = k$, a
  scheme (separated) of finite type over $\operatorname{Spec} B$ [Hir64, Ch. 0, §1, pp. 118–119].
* **Interpretation.** Kollár's schemes of finite type over a field and Włodarczyk's varieties are
  taken separated, as Hironaka's algebraic schemes are. -/

/-- `X` is *reduced and equidimensional* over `k`: `X` is reduced and its smooth locus over `k` is
smooth of a single relative dimension `d` [Kol07, Notation 64]. Over a perfect field (in the
theorems `k` has characteristic zero) the smooth locus of a reduced scheme of finite type is dense
and contains every generic point, so this says that the irreducible components of `X` all have
dimension `d`; for a smooth `X` it says that `X` is smooth of relative dimension `d`. Over an
imperfect field the smooth locus of a reduced scheme can be empty or not dense, and the condition
says less. -/

axes `xy = 0` in the plane and every reduced simple normal crossing scheme are inputs. An object

`(Y, I_Y, ∅)` and `(X, j_* I_Y, ∅)`, `B(X, j_* I_Y, ∅)` is the push-forward `j_* B(Y, I_Y, ∅)`.
A boundary is empty when it has no components (its index type is empty), however it is indexed.
