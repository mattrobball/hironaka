# Instances for the inputs of the algebraic main theorems

Instances on `AlgebraicGeometry.AlgScheme`, `AlgebraicGeometry.Triple` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.EmbeddedPair` that the proofs of the theorems use and their statements do not:
an algebraic `k`-scheme is separated, a morphism of algebraic `k`-schemes is a `k`-morphism, and
the ambient scheme of a triple or of an embedded pair is smooth. `AlgScheme.of X` is the algebraic
`k`-scheme of a scheme `X` separated and of finite type over `k`, and `AlgScheme.ofHom f` that of
a structure morphism `f`; both unfold to their underlying scheme under reducible transparency.
