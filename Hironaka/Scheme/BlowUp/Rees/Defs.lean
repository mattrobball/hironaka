# The graded Rees algebra

Mathlib's `reesAlgebra I` is the subalgebra `R[It] ⊆ R[t]` of the polynomials whose `i`-th
coefficient lies in `I ^ i`; it carries no grading there. The grading of [Hau14, Definition 4.6]
gives the variable `t` degree `1`, so that the `i`-th piece `reesAlgebra.grading I i` is `Iⁱ tⁱ`:
the polynomials all of whose coefficients of index `j ≠ i` vanish. Mathlib's polynomial variable
`X` plays the role of Hauser's `t`. The pieces are independent and span, since a polynomial is the
sum of its monomials and is determined by its coefficients (the degree-`n` component of `p` is
`(coeff n p) tⁿ`, `reesAlgebra.component`), and degrees add under products; so the Rees algebra is
a graded `R`-algebra, `reesAlgebra.gradedAlgebra`, by Mathlib's constructor
`DirectSum.IsInternal.gradedAlgebra`.

The degree-zero piece is `R` itself, embedded by `g ↦ g · t⁰` (`reesAlgebra.gradingZeroEquiv`).
A ring map `φ : R → S` with `φ(I) ⊆ J` sends `Rees(I)` into `Rees(J)` degreewise, by applying `φ`
to the coefficients (`reesAlgebra.mapOfLe`); these are the transition maps of the relative `Proj`
of the Rees algebra of an ideal sheaf [Sta, Tags 01OF and 0804].

`R` is any commutative ring and `I` any ideal: finiteness of `I` belongs to the properness of the
blow-up, not to the construction. For `I = 0` the Rees algebra is `R` in degree `0` and `0` in
positive degrees; for `I = R` it is `R[t]` with the degree grading; for the zero ring everything is
`0` [Hau14, Definition 4.6].
