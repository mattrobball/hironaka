# Chart transitions of the ideals of `J'` and the exponent of Hironaka's `J(m)`

The cross-chart step in the proof that `K_m.comap b = J' · E^m` for `m` large
(`Hironaka.Scheme.BlowUp.Composite.Main`).  A generator `g = y/a^n` (`y ∈ I^n`) of the ideal `J'_a`
of `J'` on the chart of `a` is, on the chart of `c`, the fraction `y/c^n` times the unit
`(a/c)^{-n}` of the overlap `D(a/c)`; since `J'_a` and `J'_c` cut out the same ideal sheaf on the
overlap, `y/c^n` lies in `J'_c` after multiplication by a power of `a/c`: there is `N` with
`(a/c)^N · (y/c^n) ∈ J'_c`.

* Ring level (`R` any commutative ring, `a, c ∈ I`): `fracPow I n hy = y/a^n ∈ R[I/a]`;
  `transitionHom_fracPow`: the transition `R[I/a] → R[I/a]_{c/a} ≃ R[I/c]_{a/c}` of
  `Hironaka.Scheme.BlowUp.Transition` sends `y/a^n` to `(y/c^n)·(a/c)^{-n}` — proved through the
  common embedding into `R_{ca}`;
  `exists_pow_frac_mul_mem`: from an identity `P·R[I/c]_{a/c} = Q·R[I/c]_{a/c}` of the transported
  ideals, the exponent for the elements `y/a^n ∈ P`.
* Scheme level: the two inclusions of the overlap `Spec R[I/c]_{a/c}` into the blow-up — through
  the chart of `c` and, via the transition, through the chart of `a` — are equal (`blowUp.hom_ext`:
  both are admissible morphisms over `X`), so the inverse images of `J'` agree:
  `chartIdeal_map_transition`, the identity `J'_a·R[I/c]_{a/c} = J'_c·R[I/c]_{a/c}`.

The charts of an affine blow-up glue along the localizations `R_{g_j}, R_{g_l} ⊆ R_{g_j g_l}`
[Hau14, Definition 4.13].  The overlap computations are also used for the stalks along the
exceptional divisor (`Hironaka.Scheme.IdealSheaf.Order.ExceptionalOrder`,
`Hironaka.Scheme.Snc.ChartStalk`).
