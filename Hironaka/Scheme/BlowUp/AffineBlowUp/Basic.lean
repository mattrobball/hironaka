# The affine blow-up: separatedness and properness

The affine blow-up `affineBlowUp I = Proj Rees(I)` of `Spec R` along `I`, with its map
`affineBlowUp.π I` to `Spec R` [Hau14, Definition 4.7]; [Sta, Tags 01OF and 0804], is separated,
and proper when `I` is finitely generated [Sta, Tag 02NS]. Both are inherited from Mathlib's
instances on `Proj`, `Scheme.IsSeparated (Proj 𝒜)` and `IsProper (Proj.toSpecZero 𝒜)` under
`Algebra.FiniteType (𝒜 0) A`: the Rees algebra of a finitely generated ideal is of finite type
(`reesAlgebra.finiteType_of_fg`), and the second factor of `π` is an isomorphism. The hypothesis
`I.FG` enters only here: finiteness belongs to properness, not to the construction; for `R`
Noetherian it is automatic.

The blow-up of a general scheme along a closed subscheme is glued from these affine blow-ups over
the affine opens of the base (`blowUpOf`).
