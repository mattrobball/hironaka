# The singular locus and its ideal sheaf

Consequences of the comparison of regular and smooth points for `X` locally of finite type over a
perfect field `k`: the singular locus `Sing X` is the complement of the smooth locus of
`X → Spec k` (`Hironaka/Algebra/RegularSmooth/RegularSmoothEquiv.lean`), hence closed (Mathlib's
`Scheme.Hom.isOpen_smoothLocus`; [Sta, Tag 00TT]); the regular locus is dense when `X` is reduced
and contains the generic point when `X` is integral (Mathlib's `dense_smoothLocus_of_perfectField`,
`genericPoint_mem_smoothLocus_of_perfectField`); and the ideal sheaf `𝒥` of `Sing X` with its
reduced structure is the vanishing ideal sheaf of `Sing X` (`Scheme.singIdeal`). The main
theorems (`Challenge/Algebraic.lean`) state Main Theorem I with `Sing X`.

`Sing X` need not be closed for an arbitrary scheme, and Mathlib's `IdealSheafData.vanishingIdeal`
takes a closed set; since the vanishing ideal of a set is that of its closure, `singIdeal X` is
defined for every scheme as the vanishing ideal sheaf of `closure (Sing X)`, and under the
hypotheses above its support is exactly `Sing X` (`coe_support_singIdeal_eq_singularLocus`). It is a
radical ideal sheaf (the reduced induced structure), and it is the unit ideal iff `X` is regular.
