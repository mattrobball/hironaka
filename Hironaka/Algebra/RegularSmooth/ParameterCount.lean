# Regular systems of parameters: the basis of `𝔪/𝔪²` and the size of a generating system

Two facts of commutative algebra about a regular local ring `R` with maximal ideal `𝔪`. In a
regular local ring of dimension `m`, the classes in `𝔪/𝔪²` of `m` generators of `𝔪` are linearly
independent over the residue field, since they span a space of dimension `m`
(`linearIndependent_toCotangent_of_span_eq`); and two families of elements of `𝔪` with linearly
independent classes generating the same ideal have the same size, by the dimension count of
[Sta, Tag 00NQ] (`quotient_span_range_of_linearIndependent`) applied to both families
(`card_eq_of_span_range_eq`). Not stated as such in the sources; they are the algebra behind the
comparison of two systems of local coordinates cutting out the same subspace.

Used by the submanifold and normal-crossings criteria of `Hironaka/Manifold/Snc/` and `Space/`.
