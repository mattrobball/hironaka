# The derivative of an ideal commutes with localization

For a localization `B = M⁻¹A` of a `k`-algebra `A`, `D(J B) = D(J) B` (`Ideal.derivative_map`):
the compatibility that makes the derivative of an ideal a sheaf ([Kol07, Definition 73] defines
`D(I)` through the sheaf `Der_X`; `Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/Sheaf.lean`).

* `⊇`: a `k`-derivation of `A` extends to `B` by the quotient rule (as the `∂/∂uᵢ` extend to the
  function field in the proof of [Wlo05, Lemma 2.6.3]): `Derivation.localization` of
  `Hironaka/Algebra/DerivationLocalization.lean` for `Localization M`, transported to an arbitrary
  `B` with `IsLocalization M B` along Mathlib's `IsLocalization.algEquiv`
  (`Derivation.extendToLocalization`, `extendToLocalization_algebraMap`); so
  `φ (δ f) = δ̃ (φ f) ∈ D(J B)` (`derivative_map_le`).
* `⊆`: when `Ω_{A/k}` is finitely presented, every `k`-derivation `δ'` of `B` is, up to a unit, an
  extension: its restriction `d : A → B` corresponds under `linearMapEquivDerivation` to an
  `A`-linear map `Ω_{A/k} → B`, which by Mathlib's
  `Module.FinitePresentation.exists_lift_of_isLocalizedModule` is `s⁻¹ · (φ ∘ h)` for some
  `h : Ω_{A/k} → A` and `s ∈ M` (`exists_derivation_smul_eq`); so
  `δ' (φ f) = φ(s)⁻¹ φ(δ_h f) ∈ D(J) B` for `f ∈ J`, and Leibniz extends this to all of `J B`.

Used for the derivative ideal sheaf (`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/Sheaf.lean`), its
logarithmic version (`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Derivative/LogarithmicLocalization.lean`), for
Theorem 76 on schemes (`Hironaka/Scheme/BlowUpSequence/TransformDerivative.lean`), on affine space
(`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Order/AffineSpace.lean`) and on analytic spaces
(`Hironaka/Analytic/Rueckert/Hypersurface.lean`). The statement is not in the sources.
