# The order under the local maps of étale and smooth algebras

For `R → S` smooth and a prime `q` of `S` over `p`, the local map `R_p → S_q` reflects the powers
of the maximal ideal (`OrdFaithful`, `Hironaka/Algebra/Local/OrderFlat.lean`), hence preserves the
order of every ideal: the local form of the invariance of the order under smooth morphisms stated in
[Hau03, Appendix A].

* The étale case (`ordFaithful_localRingHom_of_etale`): `R_p → S_q` is flat (the localization of a
  flat algebra at a prime lying over a prime), local, and unramified and essentially of finite
  type, so `𝔪_p S_q = 𝔪_q` ([Sta, Tag 00UW], Mathlib's
  `Algebra.FormallyUnramified.map_maximalIdeal`); the flat local lemma
  `ordFaithful_of_flat_of_map_maximalIdeal_eq` applies.
* The smooth case (`ordFaithful_localRingHom_of_isSmoothAt`): a finitely presented algebra smooth
  at `q` is, near `q`, standard étale over a polynomial algebra (Mathlib's
  `Algebra.IsSmoothAt.exists_isStandardEtale_mvPolynomial`): `S_q ≅ T_{q'}` for `T = S[1/f]`,
  `f ∉ q`, and `R → T` factors as `R → R[X₁, …, Xₙ] → T` with the second map étale.  `R_p → T_{q'}`
  is then the composite of the polynomial case (`ordFaithful_localRingHom_mvPolynomial_C`,
  `Hironaka/Algebra/Local/OrderPolynomial.lean`) and the étale case, and `OrdFaithful` composes and
  transports along isomorphisms.

Used for the invariance of the order under smooth morphisms of schemes
(`Hironaka/Scheme/IdealSheaf/Order/Smooth.lean`).

/-- The étale case: for `R → S` étale and a prime `q` of `S` over `p`, the local map `R_p → S_q`
reflects the powers of the maximal ideal.  It is flat and local with `𝔪_p S_q = 𝔪_q` (unramified
and essentially of finite type, [Sta, Tag 00UW]: Mathlib's
`Algebra.FormallyUnramified.map_maximalIdeal`), so `ordFaithful_of_flat_of_map_maximalIdeal_eq`
applies. -/
