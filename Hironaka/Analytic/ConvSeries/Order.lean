# The order of a convergent series over `K = ℝ` or `ℂ`, formally and at function level

The order `μ(f)` of a power series is Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.order` (the least degree of a
nonzero coefficient, `⊤` for `0`); for `K = ℝ` it is the order `μ_a(f) = max {k : f_a ∈ 𝔪_a^k}`
of a germ in [BM88, Definition 4.6, p. 23]. Orders add (`MvPowerSeries.order_mul`, the ring
`MvPowerSeries (Fin m) K` having no zero divisors). At function level, `μ(f) ≥ k` iff every
iterated derivative of order `< k` of the function `evalSeries f` vanishes at `0`: the iterated
derivative of order `j` is the symmetrization of the degree-`j` multilinear term
(`HasFPowerSeriesOnBall.iteratedFDeriv_eq_sum_of_completeSpace`), which is zero when the
degree-`j` coefficients vanish; conversely a vanishing derivative kills the homogeneous part of
degree `j` as a function, hence as a polynomial (`MvPolynomial.funext`), hence coefficientwise.
The function-level clause is what lets the order of a germ on a manifold be read off any
convergent expansion (`Hironaka/Manifold/IdealSheaf`).
