# The main theorems, stated against the definitions only

The main theorems of the library with every proof replaced by `sorry`, in files that import only the
modules defining the vocabulary of the statements (and `SourceAttr` with `HironakaReferences`, for
the `@[source]` tags the statements carry). These files and the import closure of those modules are the audit surface of
what the library claims.

[leanprover/comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator) (`comparator.json`) checks that
each statement here is structurally identical to the library's theorem of the same name and replays
the library's proof in the kernel with no axioms beyond `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound`. Since it compares elaborated types, each file imports only its own vocabulary and not
all of `Mathlib`: an instance the library's module does not see would elaborate a statement
differently.
